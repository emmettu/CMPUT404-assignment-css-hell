		    <p class="ph3"><i>They would never live to see the trip's<br>
			  end. So they made a few changes in their way<br>
			    of life—and many in their way of death!</i></p>

			<hr class="chap">

			  <p class="ph4">I</p>

			  <p>"I don't see why we have to be here," a crewman said. "He ain't liable
			    to say anything."</p>

			  <p>"He shore better," the man in front of him said loudly.</p>

			  <p>"Be still," his wife said. "People's lookin' at ya."</p>

			  <p>"I don't care a smidgen," he said, "if en they ayre."</p>

			  <p>"Please," she said.</p>

			  <p>"Joanne Marie," he said, "you know that when I aims ta do somethin',
			    I'm jest natcher'lly bound to do hit. An' iffen I aims ta talk...."</p>

			  <p>"Here comes the priest. Now, be still."</p>

			  <p>The man looked up. "So he do; an' I'll tell ya, hit shore is time he's
			    a-gittin' hyere. I ain't got no all night fer ta sit."</p>

			  <p>The crewman to his left bent over and whispered, "I'll bet he's gonna
			    tell us it's gonna be another postponement."</p>

			  <p>"Iffen he does, I'm jest a-gonna stand up an' yell right out that I
			    ain't gonna stand fer hit no longer."</p>

			  <p>"Now, dear," said Joanne Marie, "the captain can hear ya, if you're
			    gonna talk so loud."</p>

			  <p>"I hope he does; I jest hope he does. He's th' one that's a-keepin' us
			    all from our Reward, an' I jest hope he does heyar me, so he'll know
			    I'm a-gittin' mighty tyird uv waitin'."</p>

			  <p>"You tell 'im!" someone said from two rows behind him.</p>

			  <hr class="tb">

			    <p>The captain, in the officer's section, sat very straight and tall. He
			      was studiously ignoring the crew. This confined his field of vision to
			      the left half of the recreation area. While the priest stood before the
			      speaker's rostrum waiting for silence, the captain reached back with
			      great dignity and scratched his right shoulder blade.</p>

			    <p>Nestir, the priest, was dressed out in the full ceremonial costume
			      of office. His high, strapless boots glistened with polish. His fez
			      perched jauntily on his shiny, shaven head. The baldness was symbolic
			      of diligent mental application to abstruse points of doctrine. <i>Cotian
				exentiati pablum re overum est</i>: "Grass grows not in the middle of
			      a busy thoroughfare." The baldness was the result of the diligent
			      application of an effective depilatory. His blood-red cloak had been
			      freshly cleaned for the occasion, and it rustled around him in silky
			      sibilants.</p>

			    <p>"Men," he said. And then, more loudly, "Men!"</p>

			    <p>The hiss and sputter of conversation guttered away.</p>

			    <p>"Men," he said.</p>

			    <p>"The other evening," he said, "—Gelday it was, to be exact—one of the
			      crew came to me with a complaint."</p>

			    <p>"Well, I'll be damned," Joanne Marie's husband said loudly.</p>

			    <p>Nestir cleared his throat. "It was about the Casting Off. That's why
			      I called you all together today." He stared away, at a point over the
			      head and to the rear of the audience.</p>

			    <p>"It puts me in mind of the parable of the six Vergios."</p>

			    <p>Joanne Marie's husband sighed deeply.</p>

			    <p>"Three, you will recall, were wise. When Prophet was at Meizque, they
			      came to him and said, 'Prophet, we are afflicted. We have great sores
			      upon our bodies.' The Prophet looked at them and did see that it <i>was</i>
			      true. Then he blessed them and took out His knife and lay open their
			      sores. For which the three wise Vergios were passing grateful. And
			      within the last week, they were dead of infection. But three were
			      foolish and hid their sores; and these three did live."</p>

			    <p>The captain rubbed his nose.</p>

			    <p>"<i>Calex i pundendem hoy</i>, my children. 'Secrecy makes for a long life,'
			      as it says in the <i>Jarcon</i>." Nestir tugged behind him at his cloak.</p>

			    <p>"I want you all to remember that little story. I want you all to take
			      it away from here with you and think about it, tonight, in the privacy
			      of your cabins.</p>

			    <p>"And like the three wise Vergios who went to the Prophet, one of the
			      crewmen came to me. He came to me, and he said: 'Father, I am weary of
			      sailing.'</p>

			    <p>"Yes, he said, 'I am weary of sailing.'</p>

			    <p>"Now, don't you think I don't know that. Every one of you—every
			      blessed one of you—is weary of sailing. I know that as well as I know
			      my own name, yes.</p>

			    <p>"But because he came to me and said, 'Father, I am weary of sailing,'
			      I went to the captain, and I said, 'Captain, the men are weary of
			      sailing.'</p>

			    <p>"And then the captain said: 'All right, Father,' he said, 'I will set
			      the day for the Festival of the Casting Off!'"</p>

			    <hr class="tb">

			      <p>The little fellow was pleased by the rustle of approval from the
				audience. "God damn, hit's about time!" Joanne Marie's husband said.</p>

			      <p>Nestir cleared his throat again.</p>

			      <p>"Hummm. Uh. And the day is not very far distant," said Nestir.</p>

			      <p>"I knowed there was a catch to hit," Joanne Marie's husband said.</p>

			      <p>"I know you will have many questions; yes, I know you will have—ah,
				ah—well, many questions. You are thinking: 'What kind of a Festival
				can we have here on this ship?' You are thinking: 'What a fine
				thing—ah, what a good thing, that is—ah, how nice it would be to have
				the Casting Off at home, among friends.'"</p>

			      <p>Nestir waved his hands. "Well, I just want to tell you: I come from
				Koltah. And you know that Koltah never let any city state outdo her in
				a Festival, uh-huh.</p>

			      <p>"The arena in Koltah is the greatest arena in the whole system. We have
				as many as sixty thousand accepted applicants. All of them together in
				the arena is a—uh, uh, well—a sight to behold. People come from all
				over to behold it. I never will forget the Festival at which my father
				was accepted. He....</p>

			      <p>"Well, the point I want to make is this: I just wanted to tell you
				that I know what a Festival should be, and the captain and I will do
				everything in our power to make our Casting Off as wonderful as any
				anywhere.</p>

			      <p>"And I want to tell you that if you'll come to me with your
				suggestions, I'll do all I can to see that we do this thing just the
				way you want it done. I want you to be proud of this Casting Off
				Festival, so you can look back on it and say, uh, uh—this day was the
				real high point of your whole life!"</p>

			      <p>Everyone but Joanne Marie's husband cheered. He sat glumly muttering to
				himself.</p>

			      <p>Nestir bobbed his shiny head at them and beamed his cherubic smile. And
				noticed that there was a little blonde, one of the crewmen's wives, in
				the front row that had very cute ankles.</p>

			      <p>While they were still cheering and stomping and otherwise expressing
				their enthusiasm and approval, Nestir walked off the speaker's platform
				and into the officer's corridor. He wiped his forehead indecorously on
				the hem of his cloak and felt quite relieved that the announcement was
				over with and the public speaking done.</p>

			      <hr class="chap">

				<p class="ph4">II</p>

				<p>Dinner that evening was a gala occasion aboard the ship. The steward
				  ordered the holiday feast prepared in celebration of Nestir's
				  announcement. And, for the officers, he broke out of the special cellar
				  the last case allotment for Crew One of the delicate Colta Barauche
				  ('94). He ordered the messman to put a bottle of it to the right of
				  each plate.</p>

				<p>The captain came down from his stateroom after the meal had begun. He
				  nodded curtly to the officers when he entered the mess hall, walked
				  directly to his place at the head of the table, sat down and morosely
				  began to work the cork out of his wine bottle with his teeth.</p>

				<p>"You'll spoil the flavor, shaking it that way," the third mate
				  cautioned. He was particularly fond of that year.</p>

				<p>The captain twisted the bottle savagely, and the cork came free with a
				  little pop. He removed the cork from between his teeth, placed it very
				  carefully beside his fork, and poured himself a full glass of the wine.</p>

				<p>"Very probably," he said sadly.</p>

				<p>"I don't think hit'll do hit," the first mate said. "He hain't shook
				  hard enough to matter."</p>

				<p>The captain picked up the glass, brought it toward his lips—then,
				  suddenly having thought of something, he put it back down and turned to
				  Nestir.</p>

				<p>"I say. Have you decided on this Carstar thing yet, Father?"</p>

				<p>The little priest looked up. He laid his knife across the rim of his
				  plate. "It has ramifications," he said.</p>

				<p>When the third mate saw that his opinion on the wine was not
				  immediately to be justified, he settled back in his chair with a little
				  sigh of disapproval.</p>

				<p>"Well, what do you <i>think</i> your decision will be, Father?" the steward
				  asked.</p>

				<p>Nestir picked up his knife and fork and cut off a piece of meat.
				  "Hummmm," he said. "It's hard to say. The whole issue involves, as a
				  core point, the principle of <i>casta cum mae stotiti</i>."</p>

				<p>The first mate nodded sagely.</p>

				<p>"The intent, of course, could actually be—ah—<i>sub mailloux</i>; and in
				  that event, naturally, the decision would be even more difficult. I
				  wish I could talk to higher authority about it; but of course I haven't
				  the time. I'll have to decide something."</p>

				<hr class="tb">

				  <p>"He had a very pretty wife," the third mate said.</p>

				  <p>"Yes, very." Nestir agreed. "But as I was saying, if it could be
				    proven that the culstem fell due to no negligence on his part, either
				    consciously or subconsciously, then the obvious conclusion would be
				    that no stigma would be attached." He speared his meat and chewed it
				    thoughtfully.</p>

				  <p>"But it wasn't at all bloody," the wife of the second mate said. "I
				    scarcely think he felt it at all. It happened too fast."</p>

				  <p>Nestir swallowed the mouthful of food and washed it down with a gulp of
				    wine.</p>

				  <p>"The problem, my dear Helen," he said, "is one of intent. To raise
				    the issue of concomitant agonies is to confuse the whole matter. For
				    instance. Take Wilson, in my home state of Koltah. Certainly <i>he</i> died
				    as miserable a death as anyone could desire."</p>

				  <p>"Yes," said the second mate's wife. "I remember that. I read about it
				    in the newspapers."</p>

				  <p>"But it was a case of obvious <i>intent</i>," continued Nestir, "and
				    therefore constituted a clear out attempt to avoid his duty by
				    hastening to his Reward."</p>

				  <p>Upon hearing the word duty, the captain brightened.</p>

				  <p>"That," he said to Nestir, "my dear Father, is the cardinal point of
				    the whole game, y'know." He scratched the back of his left hand. "Duty.
				    And I must say, I think you're being quite short-sighted about the
				    Casting Off date. After all, it's not only a question of <i>how</i> we go,
				    but also a question of leaving only after having done our duty. And
				    that's equally important."</p>

				  <p>"The Synod of Cathau—" Nestir began.</p>

				  <p>"Plague take it, Father! Really, now, I must say. The Synod of Cathau!
				    Certainly you've misinterpreted that. Anticipation can be a joy,
				    y'know: almost equal to the very Reward. Anticipation should spur man
				    in duty. It's all noble and self sacrificing." He scratched the back of
				    his right hand.</p>

				  <p>The second mate had been trying to get a word in edgewise for several
				    minutes; he finally succeeded by utilizing the temporary silence
				    following the captain's outburst.</p>

				  <p>"You don't need to worry about <i>your</i> Casting Off, Captain. You can
				    leave that to me. I assure you, I have in mind a most ingenious
				    method."</p>

				  <hr class="tb">

				    <p>The captain was not visibly cheered; he was still brooding about the
				      sad absence of a sense of duty on the part of Nestir. "I will welcome
				      it," he said, "at the proper time, sir. And I certainly hope—" His
				      eyes swept the table. "I <i>certainly</i> hope to be Cast Off by an officer.
				      It would be very humiliating, y'know, to have a crew member do it."</p>

				    <p>"Oh, very," said the steward.</p>

				    <p>"I don't know," the second mate's wife said, "whether you better count
				      on my husband or not. I have my own plans for him."</p>

				    <p>"This problem of Carstar interests me," the third mate said. "Did I
				      ever tell you about my wife? She strangled our second baby."</p>

				    <p>"He was a very annoying child," his wife said.</p>

				    <p>"He probably wouldn't have lived, anyway," the third mate said. "Puny
				      baby."</p>

				    <p>"That," said Nestir, "is not at all like the Carstar case. Not at all.
				      Yours is a question of <i>saliex y cuminzund</i>."</p>

				    <p>The first mate nodded.</p>

				    <p>"It seems to me that the whole thing would depend on the intent of the
				      strangler."</p>

				    <p>"Captain," the steward said, "you really must let me give you some of
				      that salve."</p>

				    <p>"That's very kind of you, but I...."</p>

				    <p>"No bother at all," the steward said.</p>

				    <p>"As I see it," Nestir said, "if the intent was the natural maternal
				      instinct of the mother to release her child from its duty, then...."</p>

				    <p>"Oh, not at all," the third mate's wife said. "I did it to make him
				      stop crying."</p>

				    <p>"Well, in that case, I see no reason why he shouldn't get his Reward."</p>

				    <p>"I certainly hope so," the third mate said. "Jane worries about it all
				      the time."</p>

				    <p>"I do not," Jane contradicted.</p>

				    <p>"Now, honey, you know you do so."</p>

				    <p>At that moment, he lost interest in his wife and leaned across the
				      table toward the captain, "Well?" he asked.</p>

				    <p>The captain rolled the wine over his tongue. "You were right, of
				      course."</p>

				    <p>The third mate turned triumphantly to the first mate. "There, I told
				      you so."</p>

				    <p>The first mate shrugged. "I never do say nothin' right," he said. "I
				      hain't got no luck. I've spent more years un all ya, carpenterin' up a
				      duty log that's better un even th' captain's. An' hit's Martha an' me
				      that gotta wait an' help th' next crew. Lord above knows how long time
				      hit'll be afore we uns'll got ta have a Festival."</p>

				    <p>"Oh, really, now. Now. Duty, duty," the captain reprimanded him mildly.</p>

				    <p>"Duty! Duty! Duty! You all ur in a conspiracy. You all want me ta die
				      uv old age."</p>

				    <p>"Nonsense," said the steward. "We don't want anything of the sort.
				      After all, someone has to orient the new crew."</p>

				    <p>"Quite right," said the captain. "You ought to be proud."</p>

				    <hr class="tb">

				      <p>The first mate slammed his napkin in the middle of his food and stalked
					out of the mess hall.</p>

				      <p>"Quite touchy today," Nestir observed.</p>

				      <p>"By the way," the third mate said. "Wanda gave me a petition to give to
					you, Father."</p>

				      <p>"Wanda?"</p>

				      <p>"Yes. She's sixteen, now."</p>

				      <p>"Wanda who?" the steward asked.</p>

				      <p>"Wanda Miller, the bosun's daughter."</p>

				      <p>"I know her," Helen said.</p>

				      <p>"She's the oldest child on the ship, and she wants you to sign her
					adult petition so she can be in the Festival, Father."</p>

				      <p>"She's so young...."</p>

				      <p>"Sixteen, Father."</p>

				      <p>"After all, one must have done some duty," the captain said.</p>

				      <p>"He wants you to sign it so he can take her in the Changing of the
					Wives," Jane said.</p>

				      <p>Nestir fidgeted uncomfortably. "Well, I'll look at her record," he
					said.</p>

				      <p>"It's an idea," the second mate said. "Otherwise, we'll be short one
					woman."</p>

				      <p>"There wouldn't be one short if <i>he</i> had brought a wife," the first
					mate's wife said, looking squarely at the captain.</p>

				      <p>"Now, Martha. I place duty above pleasure. You're just angry, y'know,
					because you have to stay with your husband."</p>

				      <p>"All right, so I am. But it's true. And if Carstar hadn't been killed,
					there would have been two short." She shot a wicked glance at Nestir.
					"Why don't you and him share a woman—"</p>

				      <p>"Martha!"</p>

				      <p>"Although the Prophet knows what woman in her right mind would consent
					to...."</p>

				      <p>"Well," said Nestir hesitantly.</p>

				      <p>"Listen," the third mate said, "the second's right. If you don't sign
					it, someone will have to do without a woman."</p>

				      <p>Nestir blushed. "I'll look it over very carefully, but you must realize
					that the priestcraft...."</p>

				      <p>"Actually, in a way, it would be her duty to, you see. Think of it like
					that: as her way to do her duty."</p>

				      <p>"She's too young for you, dear," Jane said to her husband.</p>

				      <p>"Oh, I don't know," the steward said. "Sometimes they're the best, I
					hear."</p>

				      <hr class="chap">

					<p class="ph4">III</p>

					<p>The third mate, whose name was Harry, stood before the mirror combing
					  his hair. He had been combing his hair for the last fifteen minutes.</p>

					<p>"I suppose the crew is celebrating?" his wife said.</p>

					<p>"I suppose."</p>

					<p>She stood up and walked over to the dresser. Absently she began to
					  finger the articles on it.</p>

					<p>"You really shouldn't have told them about little Glenn tonight."</p>

					<p>"Pish-tush."</p>

					<p>"No, Harry. I mean it. Helen looked at me strangely all through dinner.
					  She has three children, you know."</p>

					<p>"You're imagining things."</p>

					<p>"But she <i>does</i> have three children."</p>

					<p>"I mean about her looking at you."</p>

					<p>"Oh."</p>

					<p>Harry fiddled with his tie without speaking.</p>

					<p>"I mean, as much as to say: 'Well, I raised all of mine.'"</p>

					<p>"But honey, about little Glenn. That was an accident, almost. You
					  didn't really mean to choke him that hard."</p>

					<p>"But still ... it ... I mean, there was Helen, looking at me like I
					  wasn't doing my duty. You know."</p>

					<p>"No," he said. "That's nonsense, Jane. Sheer nonsense. You know what
					  the priest said."</p>

					<p>He polished one of his brass buttons with the sleeve of his coat.</p>

					<p>"Harry?"</p>

					<p>"Yes?"</p>

					<p>"I don't think all that is necessary just to go on duty."</p>

					<p>"Probably not."</p>

					<p>She walked to the bed and sat down. "Harry?"</p>

					<p>"Yes, dear?"</p>

					<p>"Don't you really think she's awful young?"</p>

					<p>"Huh-uh."</p>

					<p>"I mean, why don't you pick someone else? Like Mary? She's awful sweet.
					  I'll bet she'd be better."</p>

					<p>"Probably."</p>

					<p>"She's a lot of fun."</p>

					<p>He brushed at his hair again. "Who do you want, Jane?"</p>

					<p>"Oh, I don't know." She looked down at her legs, raised them up from
					  the floor and held them out in front of her. "I think I'd kind of like
					  Nestir. With his funny bald head. I hope he asks me."</p>

					<p>"I'll mention it to him."</p>

					<p>"Would you really, Harry? That would be sweet."</p>

					<p>"Sure, honey." He looked down at his watch.</p>

					<p>"Harry? Are you going to meet Wanda in the control room?"</p>

					<p>"Uh-huh."</p>

					<p>"I thought so. Well, remember this, dear: It isn't the day of the
					  Changing of the Wives yet. Don't forget."</p>

					<p>"Honey! You don't think for a minute that...."</p>

					<p>"No, dear. I know you wouldn't. But just <i>don't</i>, I mean."</p>

					<hr class="tb">

					  <p>He walked over and kissed her forehead and patted her cheek. "Course
					    not," he said, comfortingly.</p>

					  <p>He left her sitting on the bed and strolled down the officers'
					    corridor, whistling.</p>

					  <p>He made a mental note to have the bosun send some of the crew in
					    tomorrow to wash down these bulkheads. They needed it. In one corner a
					    spider spun its silver web.</p>

					  <p>He jogged up the companionway, turned left and felt the air as fresh as
					    spring when he stepped under the great ventilator.</p>

					  <p>And beneath it lay one of the crew.</p>

					  <p>He kicked the man several times in the ribs until he came to
					    consciousness.</p>

					  <p>"Can't sleep here, my man," Harry explained.</p>

					  <p>"Awww. Go way an' le' me 'lone, huh?"</p>

					  <p>"Here. Here." He pulled the fellow erect and slapped him in the face
					    briskly. "This is the officers' corridor."</p>

					  <p>"Oh? Ish it? Schorry. Shore schorry, shir. So schorry."</p>

					  <p>Harry assisted him to the crew's corridor where he sank to the floor
					    and relapsed once more into a profound slumber.</p>

					  <p>Harry continued on to the control room.</p>

					  <p>When he entered it, the second mate was yawning.</p>

					  <p>"Hi, John. Sleepy?"</p>

					  <p>"Uh-huh. You're early."</p>

					  <p>"Don't mind, do you?"</p>

					  <p>"No ... Quiet tonight. Had to cut the motors an hour ago. Control
					    technician passed out."</p>

					  <p>"Oh?"</p>

					  <p>The second mate took out a cigarette and lit it. "Can't blow the ship
					    up, you know. Look like hell on the record. Hope the captain don't find
					    out about it, though. He'll figure the man was neglecting his duty."</p>

					  <p>He blew a smoke ring.</p>

					  <p>"Might even bar him from the Festival."</p>

					  <p>"Yeah," said Harry, "the captain's funny that way."</p>

					  <p>The second mate blew another smoke ring.</p>

					  <p>"Well," Harry said.</p>

					  <p>"Uh. Harry? Are you really going to take that Wanda girl?"</p>

					  <p>"If Nestir lets me."</p>

					  <p>"Say. Harry. Do you suppose your wife would...?"</p>

					  <hr class="tb">

					    <p>Harry crossed to the second mate and put a hand on his shoulder.
					      "Sorry, old fellow. She's got it in her head to take Nestir." He
					      shrugged. "I don't exactly approve, of course, but ... I'm sure if he
					      doesn't want her, she'd be glad to hear your offer."</p>

					    <p>"Aw, that's all right," John said. "Don't really matter. Say. By the
					      way. Have I told you what I intend to do to the captain? I've got it
					      all thought out. You know that saber I picked up on Queglat? Well...."</p>

					    <p>"Look. How about telling me another time?"</p>

					    <p>"Uh, Sure. If you say so. Uh?"</p>

					    <p>"I'm kind of expecting Wanda."</p>

					    <p>"Oh. Sure. I should have known you weren't here early for nothing. In
					      that case, I better be shoving off. Luck."</p>

					    <p>"Thanks. See you at breakfast."</p>

					    <p>"Right-o."</p>

					    <p>After the second mate left, Harry walked over to the control panel.
					      The jet lights were dead. He picked up the intercom and switched over
					      the engine call bell. "'Lo," he said into the microphone. "This is
					      the bridge.... Oh, hi, Barney. Harry.... Have you got a sober control
					      technician down there yet...? Fine. We'll start the jets again. If the
					      captain comes in now—well, you know how he is.... Okay, thanks. Night."</p>

					    <p>He replaced the microphone. He reached over and threw the forward
					      firing lever. The jet lights came on and the ship began to brake
					      acceleration again.</p>

					    <p>Having done that, he switched on the space viewer. The steady buzz of
					      the equipment warming sounded in his ears. Wanda would be sure to want
					      to look at the stars. She was simple minded.</p>

					    <p>"Hello."</p>

					    <p>He swiveled around. "Oh, hello, Wanda, honey."</p>

					    <p>"Hello, Haireee. Are you glad little ol' me could come, huh?"</p>

					    <p>"Sure am."</p>

					    <p>"Me, too. Can I look at the—oh. It's already on."</p>

					    <p>"Uh-huh. Look. Wanda."</p>

					    <p>"Hum?"</p>

					    <p>"I talked to Nestir today."</p>

					    <p>"Goody. What did he say, huh? I can be an adult and get to play in the
					      Festival, can I?"</p>

					    <p>"I don't know, yet. He's thinking about it. That's why I want to see
					      you. He's going to check your record. And Wanda?"</p>

					    <p>"Them stars shore are purty."</p>

					    <p>"Wanda, listen to me."</p>

					    <p>"I'm a-listenin', Haireee."</p>

					    <p>"You're simply going to have to stop carrying that doll around with you
					      if you want to be an adult."</p>

					    <hr class="tb">

					      <p>In Nestir's cabin the next morning, the captain and the priest held a
						conference.</p>

					      <p>"No, Captain. I'm afraid I can't agree to that," Nestir said.</p>

					      <p>The captain said, "Oh, don't be unreasonable, Father. After all, this
						is a ship, y'know. And I am, after all, the captain."</p>

					      <p>Nestir shook his head. "The crew and the officers will participate
						together in the Festival. I will not put the officers' corridor off
						limits, and—Oh! Yes? Come in!"</p>

					      <p>The door opened. "Father?"</p>

					      <p>"Yes, my son? Come in."</p>

					      <p>"Thank you, Father. Good morning, Captain, sir."</p>

					      <p>"Sit down, my son. Now, Captain, as I was saying: no segregation. It's
						contrary to the spirit, if not the wording, of the <i>Jarcon</i>."</p>

					      <p>"But Father! A crewman! In the officers' corridor! Think!"</p>

					      <p>"Before the Prophet, we are all equal. I'm sorry, Captain. Now on
						Koltah, we practiced it with very good results, and...."</p>

					      <p>"I say, really—"</p>

					      <p>"Father?" said the crewman who had just entered.</p>

					      <p>"Yes, my son. In one moment. Now, Captain. As I have been explaining:
						The arena method has advantages. In Koltah we always used it. But
						here—due to the—ah—exigencies of deep space—I feel convinced that
						a departure from normal procedure is warranted. It is not without
						precedent. Such things were fairly common, <i>in astoli tavoro</i>, up
						until centralization, three hundred years before Allth. Indeed, in my
						home city—Koltah—in the year of the seventh plague, a most unusual
						expedient was adopted. It seems...."</p>

					      <p>"You're perfectly correct, of course," the captain said.</p>

					      <p>"That's just what I wanted to see you about, Father," the crewman said.
						"Now, in my city state of Ni, for the Festivals, we...."</p>

					      <p>"Shut up," said the captain softly.</p>

					      <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

					      <p>"Now, as I was saying, Captain, when the methods used in...."</p>

					      <p>"If you'll excuse me, Father, I really should return to duty," said the
						crewman.</p>

					      <p>"Quite all right, my son. Close the door after you."</p>

					      <p>"I must say, fellow, your sense of duty is commendable."</p>

					      <p>"Well, uh, thank you, sir. And thank you, Father, for your time."</p>

					      <p>"Quite all right, my son. That's what I'm here for. Come in as often as
						you like."</p>

					      <p>The crewman closed the door after him.</p>

					      <hr class="tb">

						<p>He had been gone only a moment, scarcely time for Nestir to get
						  properly launched on his account, when Harry, the third mate, knocked
						  on the door and was admitted.</p>

						<p>"Oh? Good morning, Captain. I didn't know you were here." Then, to the
						  priest: "I'll come back later, Father."</p>

						<p>"Nonsense," said the captain. "Come in."</p>

						<p>"Well, I had hoped to see the Father for a minute on ... private
						  business."</p>

						<p>"I have to be toddling along," said the captain.</p>

						<p>"But Captain! I haven't finished telling you about...."</p>

						<p>"I'll just go down and get a cup of coffee," the captain said.</p>

						<p>"I'll call you when I'm through," said Harry.</p>

						<p>The captain left the room.</p>

						<p>"It's about Wanda, Father," said the third mate.</p>

						<p>The priest studied the table top. He rearranged some papers. "Ah, yes.
						  The young girl."</p>

						<p>"Well, I mean, it's not only about Wanda," said Harry. "You see, my
						  wife, Jane, that is...."</p>

						<p>"Yes?" said the priest. He took his pen out of the holder.</p>

						<p>"I think, with the proper ... ah ... you know. What I mean is, I think
						  she might look with favor on you in the Changing of the Wives, if I
						  said a few well chosen words in your behalf."</p>

						<p>"That is very flattering, my son." He returned the pen to the holder.
						  "Such bounty, as it says in the <i>Jarcon</i>, is <i>cull tensio</i>."</p>

						<p>"And with your permission, Father...."</p>

						<p>"Ah...."</p>

						<p>"She's a very pretty woman."</p>

						<p>"Ah.... Quite so."</p>

						<p>"Well, about Wanda. I really shouldn't mention this. But Father, if we
						  <i>are</i> short one woman...."</p>

						<p>"Hummmm."</p>

						<p>"I mean, the girls might think a man gets rusty."</p>

						<p>"I see what you mean." Nestir blinked his eyes. "It wouldn't be fair,
						  all things considered."</p>

						<p>He stood up.</p>

						<p>"I may tell you, my son, that, in thinking this matter over last night,
						  I decided that Wanda—ah—Miller, yes, has had sufficient duty to merit
						  participation in the Festival."</p>

						<p>"Justice is a priestly virtue," Harry said.</p>

						<p>"And you really think your wife would...?"</p>

						<p>"Oh, yes, Father."</p>

						<p>"Well, ahem. But...."</p>

						<p>"Yes, Father?"</p>

						<p>"<i>Ad dulce verboten.</i>"</p>

						<p>"Uh?"</p>

						<p>"That is to say, in order for a woman to join in the ritual of the
						  Changing of the Wives, she must, ahem, be married."</p>

						<p>"I never thought of that," said the third mate disconsolately.</p>

						<p>"I think that can be arranged, however," said Nestir. "If you go by the
						  mess hall on your way out, please tell the captain we can continue our
						  discussion at his pleasure."</p>

						<hr class="chap">

						  <p class="ph4">IV</p>

						  <p>"Sit down, Captain," said Nestir, when the captain entered. "No. Over
						    there, in the comfortable chair. There. Are you comfortable, Captain?"</p>

						  <p>"Of course I am."</p>

						  <p>"Good. I have a question to ask you, Captain."</p>

						  <p>"I say?"</p>

						  <p>Nestir rubbed his bald head. "Sir," he said by way of preamble, "I know
						    you have the greatest sensibility in questions of duty."</p>

						  <p>"That's quite so, y'know. I pride myself upon it, if I do say so."</p>

						  <p>"Exactly. <i>Argot y calpex.</i> No sacrifice is too great."</p>

						  <p>"True; true."</p>

						  <p>"Well, then, say the first day of Wenslaus, that would be—ah, a
						    Zentahday—I may depend upon you to wed Wanda Miller, the bosun's
						    daughter, yes?"</p>

						  <p>"No," said the captain.</p>

						  <p>"Come now, sir. I realize she is the daughter of a crewman, but—"</p>

						  <p>"Father," said the captain, "did I ever tell you about the time I led
						    an expeditionary force against Zelthalta?"</p>

						  <p>"I don't believe you have."</p>

						  <p>"Then I will tell you. Came about this way. I was given command of
						    fifty-three thousand Barains. Savage devils. Uncivilized, but fine
						    fighters. I was to march them ninety-seven miles across the desert
						    that...."</p>

						  <p>"Captain! I fear I must be very severe with you. I will be forced to
						    announce in the mess hall this evening that you have refused to do
						    your duty when it was plainly and properly called to your attention."</p>

						  <p>"Very well, Father," the captain said after several minutes. "I will do
						    it."</p>

						  <p>He was trembling slightly.</p>

						  <hr class="tb">

						    <p>That morning was to be the time of the captain's wedding. He had
						      insisted that it be done in privacy. For the ceremony, he refused to
						      make the slightest change in his everyday uniform; nor would he consent
						      to Nestir's suggestion that he carry a nosegay of hydroponic flowers.
						      He had intended, after the ceremony, to go about his duty as if nothing
						      out of the ordinary had happened; but after it was done with, the vast
						      indignity of it came home to him even more poignantly than he had
						      imagined it would.</p>

						    <p>Without a word, he left the priest's stateroom and walked slowly,
						      ponderously, with great dignity, to his own.</p>

						    <p>It was a very fine stateroom. The finest, but for Nestir's, in the
						      whole ship. The velvet and gold drapes (his single esthetic joy) were
						      scented with exotic perfume. The carpet was an inch and a half thick.</p>

						    <p>He walked through his office without breaking his stride.</p>

						    <p>The bed was large and fluffy. An unbroken expanse of white coverlette
						      jutting out from the far bulkhead. It looked as soft as feather down.</p>

						    <p>Without even a sigh, he threw himself upon the bed and lay very, very
						      quiet. His left leg was suspended in the air, intersecting, at the
						      thigh, the plane of the coverlet at forty-five degrees; the number of
						      degrees remained stiffly, unrelaxingly forty-five.</p>

						    <p>Only after a long, long time did he roll over on his back and then it
						      was merely to stare fixedly at the ceiling.</p>

						    <p>It is entirely possible that he would have lain there until Doomsday
						      had not his introspection been, around noon, interrupted by an
						      apologetic tap on the door.</p>

						    <p>"Come in," he whispered, hoping she would not hear him and go away.</p>

						    <p>But she heard him.</p>

						    <p>"Husband," Wanda said simply. She closed the door behind her and stood
						      staring at him.</p>

						    <p>"Madam," he said, "I hope you will have the kindness not to refer to me
						      by that indecent appelation a second time."</p>

						    <p>"Gee. You say the cutest things. I'm awful glad you had to marry me,
						      huh."</p>

						    <p>The captain stood up, adjusted his coat and his shoulders, and walked
						      across the room to the dressing table. He opened the left-hand drawer,
						      removed a bottle, poured himself half a water-glass full and drank it
						      off.</p>

						    <p>"Ah," he said.</p>

						    <p>He returned to the bed and sat down.</p>

						    <p>"Can'tcha even say hello ta little ol' me, huh?" she asked.</p>

						    <p>"Hello," he said. "Madam, sit down. I intend to give you an instructive
						      lecture in the natural order of...."</p>

						    <p>"Huh?"</p>

						    <p>"Ah," he said. "Quite true, of course."</p>

						    <p>She walked over to the chair and sat down. "I don't like them," she
						      said. "Them cloth things over there."</p>

						    <p>"Those, Madam," he said, "are priceless drapes I had imported from the
						      province of San Xalthan. They have a long, strange history.</p>

						    <p>"About three thousand years ago, a family by the name of Soong was
						      forced to flee from the city of Xan because the eldest son of the
						      family had become involved in a conspiracy against the illustrious King
						      Fod. As the Soong family was traveling...."</p>

						    <p>"I don't like 'em anyway," said Wanda.</p>

						    <p>"Madam," said the captain, "kindly bring me that."</p>

						    <p>"This?"</p>

						    <p>"Yes. Thank you."</p>

						    <p>He took the doll from her. He got up again, walked to the chest of
						      drawers, searched around for a penknife. Finally he located it under a
						      stack of socks.</p>

						    <hr class="chap">

						      <div class="figcenter">

							<hr class="chap">

							  <p>He returned to the bed. Sitting on the edge, he began to rip the doll
							    along the seams with the penknife. Very carefully he emptied the
							    sawdust out upon the carpet, and with equal deliberation, he cut up
							    the canvas covering into small patches. Within fifteen minutes, for he
							    worked very slowly, the doll was completely destroyed.</p>

							  <p>He laid the penknife on the night stand by his bed. He took out a match
							    and struck it across the bottom of his shoe; he bent over and ignited
							    the remains of the doll.</p>

							  <p>"You'll burn yer rug," Wanda said.</p>

							  <p>"Yes," the captain said, "I will. Be so kind as to close the door when
							    you leave."</p>

							  <hr class="chap">

							    <p class="ph4">V</p>

							    <p>The next day the captain appeared at mess.</p>

							    <p>The third mate said, "I want to thank you for what you done for me,
							      Captain."</p>

							    <p>"Don't mention it," the captain said, bisecting a pilchard with his
							      fork.</p>

							    <p>"It's nice Wanda gets to be in the Festival," Jane said. "It pleases my
							      husband so."</p>

							    <p>"I'm very excited about it all," the steward said.</p>

							    <p>The first mate turned his egg over with his fork and peered
							      suspiciously at the underside of it. "Hit's all right fur you uns ta
							      feel excited. Martha an' me are still purty bitter."</p>

							    <p>"Yes," Martha said, "I don't see why the children couldn't take care of
							      themselves."</p>

							    <p>"Who'd get the new crew out of ice?" John, the second mate, said.</p>

							    <p>"That," the first mate admitted, "is th' problem. Can'tcha even cook an
							      aig?" he asked the steward.</p>

							    <p>"What's the matter with the egg?" the third mate asked.</p>

							    <p>"Hit hain't cooked right," the first mate insisted.</p>

							    <p>"Helen," the captain said, "may I see you after the meal?"</p>

							    <p>Helen looked demurely into her plate. "Certainly, captain. But if it's
							      about the Changing of the Wives, I've already been asked for."</p>

							    <p>"And," John said proudly, "I'll bet she was one of the first ones
							      asked."</p>

							    <p>"Nestir asked my wife almost a month ago," said Harry. "She was the
							      very first."</p>

							    <p>"Well," the captain said, "that's what I had in mind." He turned to
							      survey the table. His eyes lit upon Mary, the steward's wife.</p>

							    <p>She looked at him and shook her head. "John already asked me."</p>

							    <p>"Well," the captain said, "I must say, this is a very fine breakfast,
							      steward. I dearly love pilchards for breakfast. Convey my compliments
							      to the cook."</p>

							    <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

							    <hr class="tb">

							      <p>"Captain," said Nestir, "I was telling the men ... just before you
								came ... in about the great pageant of Koltah in the year of '93. At
								the time, in a special celebration—<i>annum mirabelei</i>—we decided
								to observe the ancient customs of Meizque. The customs are of some
								interest, and I thought we might apply several of them to our own
								Festival."</p>

							      <p>"Whatever you wish," said the captain tiredly, stirring his coffee.</p>

							      <p>Before Nestir could resume his account, John interrupted. "I want to
								mention this again. I have a very special treatment for you, Captain.
								You should be encouraged by that. No one will ever have a better
								Casting Off than you."</p>

							      <p>"Thank you," said the captain. "I shall look forward to it." He laid
								down his spoon. "Oh, Anne. May I see you?"</p>

							      <p>"I'm sorry," said the wife of Barney, the engineer. "Really and truly I
								am, but I've already been asked, too."</p>

							      <p>"Oh," said the captain.</p>

							      <p>He looked over at the last officer's wife, Leota. But he quickly looked
								away.</p>

							      <p>"Well," he said, "this is a fine breakfast we have this morning
								steward."</p>

							      <p>"Thank you, sir. I'll tell the cook."</p>

							      <p>Jane said, in order to stave off the encroaching silence, "Nestir, how
								old are you?"</p>

							      <p>"Going on forty—Jane."</p>

							      <p>"The prime of life," the steward said.</p>

							      <p>"Ah," the captain said thoughtfully. "Leota...."</p>

							      <p>She looked up and soundlessly her mouth formed the words, "Too late."</p>

							      <p>The captain dropped the spoon to his plate.</p>

							      <p>Silence fell. It grew prolonged and uncomfortable. Finally the first
								mate said, "Hit hain't the right way to cook aigs, damn hit."</p>

							      <p>The captain said, "Father, I say. All the officers' wives have been
								asked."</p>

							      <p>"Yes," said Nestir. "They have, haven't they?"</p>

							      <p>"Do you suppose it would be all right if I just...."</p>

							      <p>"You know the rules," Nestir said sternly.</p>

							      <p>"That's what I was afraid you'd say," said the captain. He looked up
								at the ceiling; his face was placid. He reached up with his right hand
								and began to scratch his chin. He scratched his chin for a long time,
								scarcely breathing.</p>

							      <p>The officers and their wives were silent, waiting for him to speak.</p>

							      <hr class="tb">

								<p>"I believe I'll have another cup of coffee," he said at last.</p>

								<p>"Yes, sir," said the steward, snapping his fingers for the waiter.</p>

								<p>Martha said: "You should have asked earlier."</p>

								<p>"I know," the captain said. "Father, I really don't see why I have to
								  Change Wives."</p>

								<p>"But Harry will have yours that day. And you know the rules."</p>

								<p>"There are a lot of good-looking women in the crew," the steward said.</p>

								<p>"Quite a number," said the captain.</p>

								<p>He arose from the table and steadied himself a moment. "Never mind the
								  coffee," he said. "I shouldn't drink over one cup for breakfast. I
								  believe it aggravates my scrofula."</p>

								<p>He turned, and walked out of the mess hall.</p>

								<p>He walked very straight and tall. He walked down the crew's corridor
								  toward their quarters.</p>

								<p>Shortly he saw a woman coming out of one of the cabins.</p>

								<p>"Madam," he said.</p>

								<p>She came over to him. "Yes, sir?"</p>

								<p>"Madam," he said, "Madam, I...."</p>

								<p>"Would ja like to have a drink of water? It's right down this way, an'
								  then ya turn ta the left."</p>

								<p>"No ... uh. I.... Madam, would you honor me by becoming my partner for
								  the night of the Changing of the Wives?"</p>

								<p>She balanced on the balls of her feet and looked up at him. "Yur th'
								  captain, ain'tcha?"</p>

								<p>"Yes," he said. "I am."</p>

								<p>"Sure, I'll do hit," she said. "I'd be mighty proud ta."</p>

								<p>The captain turned away and then turned back. "Madam," he said, "what
								  is your name?"</p>

								<p>"Joanne Marie. Jest ask for me. Everybody down here knows me."</p>

								<p>"Joanne Marie, Joanne Marie," he repeated under his breath. He
								  shuddered and turned to go.</p>

								<hr class="chap">

								  <p class="ph4">VI</p>

								  <p>The day of the Changing of the Wives came to the ship. It was a very
								    important ritualistic day, held, always, three weeks and one day before
								    the Festival of the Casting Off.</p>

								  <p>The morning of the day, Nestir spoke to the assembled complement.
								    He explained its symbolic importance: he explained its historic
								    development; he delivered, <i>in cretia ultimatum est</i>, an exegesis on
								    the <i>Jarcon</i>. And then he took off the cloak of priestcraft and cast it
								    to the floor. "For I am," he said, "Ah, a man as you are men."</p>

								  <p>Then, being no longer empowered to pronounce a benediction (under
								    normal conditions, the function of a younger priest), he left the
								    cheering members of Flight Seventeen A and sped directly to his
								    stateroom.</p>

								  <p>The afternoon passed uneventfully. The complement of the ship moved
								    about their routine chores tingling in anticipation of the evening.</p>

								  <p>At the evening meal, a new seating arrangement was instituted at the
								    insistence of the steward and the third mate. The newly formed couples
								    were to sit side by side.</p>

								  <p>To accomplish this, it was necessary to set two extra plates in the
								    officers' mess. One, for Wanda, next to the third mate; and one, for
								    Joanne Marie, beside the captain.</p>

								  <p>"Please pass the meat," the third mate said.</p>

								  <p>Nestir handed it across to him.</p>

								  <p>"Thank you, Father."</p>

								  <p>"Today, <i>in culpa res</i>, I no longer have that honor," Nestir reminded
								    him. "The blood-red cloak of priestcraft will never again touch my
								    shoulders this side of the Reward."</p>

								  <p>"I'd be a little sad," said the steward.</p>

								  <p>"Oh, I don't know," the third mate said.</p>

								  <p>"It probably all depends," Helen, the wife of the second mate, agreed.</p>

								  <p>"Hit's a far, far better thing <i>I</i> do," the first mate said sonorously.
								    He was a little drunk.</p>

								  <p>The captain speared one pea and ate it. "I envy you," he said, looking
								    over at Joanne Marie.</p>

								  <p>Wanda Miller, who had already upset her glass of water in the third
								    mate's lap, said, "Pass the biscuits, hey.... You uns have better'n we
								    do."</p>

								  <p>"No," said the steward, "not at all, my dear. We eat the same as the
								    crew."</p>

								  <p>"Yes; precisely so," the third mate said.</p>

								  <p>"Except ours is fixed up a little differently," said Jane.</p>

								  <p>"An' our cook can't fry an aig," the first mate said.</p>

								  <p>"I wouldn't say that," said the captain.</p>

								  <p>"Shucks," Joanne Marie said, "anybody can fry an aig."</p>

								  <p>"On the contrary, Madam. I recall once, when I was a political adviser
								    for the Kong regime...."</p>

								  <p>"Do you mean mea-Kong?" the steward asked.</p>

								  <p>"No, that was in Koltah."</p>

								  <p>"Yes," Nestir said. "I am very familiar with them. They...."</p>

								  <p>"That's not the one I meant," the captain snapped.</p>

								  <p>Nestir leaped to his feet. "Well!" he said loudly. "I'm through
								    eating."</p>

								  <p>"Oh, come now, old man. There's no hurry, really, y'know," the captain
								    insisted gently.</p>

								  <p>"Ain't there?" Joanne Marie asked. "Gee. I can see you sure ain't like
								    my husband. I mean my ex." She giggled.</p>

								  <p>"Well, I guess I'm finished, too," Jane said. "Well. Good night, Harry."</p>

								  <p>"Good night, dear."</p>

								  <hr class="tb">

								    <p>In the mess hall, the lights were out. The figure of the captain loomed
								      like a stark obelisk in the gloom.</p>

								    <p>"Captain, sir, we uns uv been sittin' here at this table fur hours an'
								      hours. I'm gettin' purty tired us sittin'."</p>

								    <p>"It's not long until the Festival," he said.</p>

								    <p>"When the mess boy cleared away all them dishes, I thought shore you'd
								      leave, then."</p>

								    <p>"Oh, no," said the captain. "This is very exciting."</p>

								    <p>"It ain't, the way I see it," Joanne Marie said.</p>

								    <p>"Different perspective, Madam. Doubtless you would not have considered
								      it very exciting either, the time I ran a wagon train from Tamask-Cha.
								      You see, the material was to be delivered on a mining contract. Madam,
								      I can assure you it was hot. The only road was a narrow line across the
								      Ubiq desert. And late the first evening...."</p>

								    <p>"I can see it warn't very exciting," Joanne Marie said.</p>

								    <p>Silence returned.</p>

								    <p>"I am getting sleepy," the captain said at length.</p>

								    <p>"Oh, I'm usually awake this late. Shucks, I'm used to it. Sometimes I
								      jest get ta sleep when it's time ta get up. But I do wish we'd go to
								      bed."</p>

								    <p>"Madam, your language!"</p>

								    <p>"All I said was...."</p>

								    <p>"I know; I know," the captain said. "Madam, come to my stateroom. You
								      may sleep on the sofa."</p>

								    <p>"Weeeel," Joanne Marie said, "I ain't a-sayin' that. I know my rights."</p>

								    <p>"Let us not be difficult. I am certain, when I explain to you in a
								      logical fashion the obvious impossibility of—of—"</p>

								    <p>"You got no wife?"</p>

								    <p>"No," he said.</p>

								    <p>"Yeah. I thought not. That sure is swell."</p>

								    <p>"Madam. Perhaps I can say it this way. I have certain perturbations,
								      but I can assure you, whatever you attempt my aim is inflexible. For
								      me, the Captain, to—ah—consort with a crew woman is preposterous."</p>

								    <p>"Is that what you call it? Now that's a funny word. My husband calls
								      it—"</p>

								    <p>"<i>Madam!</i>"</p>

								    <p>Joanne Marie was cowed into silence. They walked directly to his
								      stateroom.</p>

								    <p>Once inside, Joanne Marie said, "Now ya jest sit down, comfortable
								      like. I got somethin' I want to tell ya."</p>

								    <p>"No," the captain said.</p>

								    <p>"I ain't even told ja yet."</p>

								    <p>"It won't matter," the captain said.</p>

								    <p>"My husband don't like me," she said.</p>

								    <p>He dropped his head into his hands and sighed deeply. Then he looked
								      up, his face set in icy resignation.</p>

								    <hr class="chap">

								      <p class="ph4">VII</p>

								      <p>John, the second mate, awoke early the morning of the Festival.</p>

								      <p>"Helen, honey," he said. "Wake up."</p>

								      <p>She murmured sleepily.</p>

								      <p>"Come on, now, wake up."</p>

								      <p>She rolled over to her side of the bed.</p>

								      <p>"All right," he said. He reached out, fumbled for and found his
									cigarettes.</p>

								      <p>"You know what I'm going to do to the captain?" he asked. He lit a
									cigarette and lying on his back blew smoke rings at the ceiling.</p>

								      <p>"Yes," his wife said, "you told me."</p>

								      <p>"First, I'm going to take that saber I got on Queglat and scrape open
									his scrofula. Then, when he's bleeding nicely, all I have to do is
									pour a bottle of alcohol on him. Don't you think that will be nice?"</p>

								      <p>"Yes, dear."</p>

								      <p>"You know, I'm kinda sorry I went to all the trouble sharpening that
									saber. After all, it might be more painful if the saber was dull."</p>

								      <p>"Yes, dear."</p>

								      <p>"But then, on the other hand...."</p>

								      <p>"Dear, will you hand me a cigarette?"</p>

								      <p>"Sure."</p>

								      <p>He shook out a cigarette, lit it off his and handed it to her.</p>

								      <p>"So what do you think?"</p>

								      <p>"It doesn't matter, dear," she said.</p>

								      <p>"Oh, but it does matter," John insisted. "I think it's very important."
									He snubbed out his cigarette. "It's all the little details that one
									should take into account. Can't be too careful about something like
									that."</p>

								      <p>He rolled over on his back again. "I'm hungry," he said.</p>

								      <p>"I really thought they should have served breakfast," Helen said.</p>

								      <p>"Well, it wouldn't be right to leave all those dirty dishes for the
									second crew."</p>

								      <p>"I mean just sandwiches."</p>

								      <p>"Yes," he said, "they could have made up some sandwiches. I think,
									though, I'd settle for a cup of tea."</p>

								      <p>"I could brew you some on the hot plate."</p>

								      <p>"It's too much bother," John said. "Are you sure you wouldn't mind?"</p>

								      <p>"No. If you'll get up and put the water on."</p>

								      <p>"All right," he said.</p>

								      <p>He threw his legs over the side, fumbled with his feet for the house
									slippers, padded to the hot plate, put the water on, and came back to
									bed.</p>

								      <p>"We've still got an hour before the bell," he said.</p>

								      <p>"Are you going to shave?"</p>

								      <p>"I don't think so; not today," he said.</p>

								      <p>"By the way, honey; what's in that can over there?"</p>

								      <p>"Fuel oil," she said.</p>

								      <p>"What's it for?"</p>

								      <p>"You'd be surprised," she said.</p>

								      <p>After a while, the water began to sizzle against the sides of the pan.</p>

								      <p>"Time to get up," she said. She crawled over her husband, slipped into
									a robe, and proceeded to brew the tea.</p>

								      <p>"It's not much of a breakfast, John."</p>

								      <p>"Say," he said, "where's my bottle of alcohol for the captain."</p>

								      <p>"I set it over by the medicine cabinet, out of the way."</p>

								      <p>"I wonder if it'll be enough?" he mused.</p>

								      <p>"I hope so," she said. "Are you going to get up, or must I serve you
									this tea in bed? I will if you want me to."</p>

								      <p>"I'll get up," he said. He got up.</p>

								      <p>"Let's take it in the nook to drink," he said.</p>

								      <p>"Can't."</p>

								      <p>"Oh? Why not?"</p>

								      <p>"One of the legs is off the table."</p>

								      <p>"If you'd told me, I'd fixed it."</p>

								      <p>"Never mind," she said.</p>

								      <hr class="tb">

									<p>They each drank two cups of tea; and then each dressed for the Festival.</p>

									<p>After that, they sat in silence, awaiting the bell to signal the start
									  of the Festival.</p>

									<p>"I'm going to hurry out," John said at length, "as soon as the bell
									  rings, so I can stand outside the captain's door and get him when he
									  comes out."</p>

									<p>"That's not fair, John," she said. "You're supposed to wait for the
									  second bell before you can even start to Cast anyone Off."</p>

									<p>"I know," said John, "but this way, I'll be sure to get the captain."</p>

									<p>"Well," she said, "I'm certainly glad you have that attitude."</p>

									<p>He asked, after more silence, "What are you going to do?"</p>

									<p>"I think I'll stay here for a little while," she said.</p>

									<p>"Yes, that might—"</p>

									<p>The bell rang soundingly throughout the ship.</p>

									<p>"Time to go," John said. He grabbed his saber. "Where's the alcohol?"</p>

									<p>"In there," she said.</p>

									<p>He skidded into the bathroom, pocketed the alcohol, and started for the
									  door.</p>

									<p>"John!"</p>

									<p>"Huh?"</p>

									<p>"Aren't you even going to kiss me good-by?"</p>

									<p>"Oh, sure. Forgot." He crossed to her, bent down and kissed her. She
									  put her left arm around his neck. With her right hand, she located the
									  table leg she had placed behind her pillow.</p>

									<p>John drew away and half turned. "Good—"</p>

									<p>She hit him in the left temple with the table leg. He went down like a
									  poleaxed steer.</p>

									<p>She laughed happily.</p>

									<hr class="chap">

									  <p class="ph4">VIII</p>

									  <p>When the bell sounded for the people to separate, preparatory to the
									    hunt proper, the captain got up and buckled on his huge infantry sword.
									    He had spent most of the night sharpening it.</p>

									  <p>He had after long hours of considering, decided that there was only one
									    honorable course left to him. He would defend himself.</p>

									  <p>For if he were the Sole Survivor of the hunt, he would be Cast Off
									    properly by the first mate. Otherwise....</p>

									  <p>The possibility that it might be done by a crewman was staggeringly
									    humiliating. He would salvage his honor from that final indignity at
									    all costs.</p>

									  <p>Of course, if he were captured by an officer, it would be a different
									    matter entirely; he would surrender and submit like the gentleman he
									    was. But a crewman....</p>

									  <p>He took the sword out of the scabbard and rubbed his thumb along the
									    side of it.</p>

									  <p>He swung it, and it whistled in the air crisply, pleasingly.</p>

									  <p>He grasped it firmly in his right hand and walked to the door. He threw
									    open the door and jumped back and away.</p>

									  <p>But it was safe; there was no one outside.</p>

									  <p>He stepped into the corridor.</p>

									  <p>Empty.</p>

									  <p>He looked both ways. He listened.</p>

									  <p>Then he began to run, swiftly, silently, on his toes.</p>

									  <p>At the first intersection, he stopped and surveyed the crossing
									    corridor.</p>

									  <p>To his left, almost at the far bend, he saw a crewman; however, the man
									    was not looking in his direction, and the captain felt that he could
									    be reasonably safe from detection if he crossed quickly enough. He
									    sprinted across the open space.</p>

									  <p>On the other side, he stopped and waited. After several minutes of
									    silence, he knew that he could safely continue.</p>

									  <p>He ran for a long distance.</p>

									  <p>Finally, safely down in the second level, he slowed to a walk. He was
									    breathing heavily; it was very loud, and his footsteps echoed hollowly.</p>

									  <p>He was alone down there. He could tell that.</p>

									  <p>At the Jonson bend, he breathed a sigh of relief. Ahead was the empty
									    corridor that led to the dead end, Forward. He could see down it, clear
									    to the bulkhead. And as he knew it would be, it was devoid of life and
									    movement.</p>

									  <p>He sat down to wait out the long day.</p>

									  <p>He scratched his chin.</p>

									  <p>He would have nothing to do until the closing bell. At which time he
									    would be forced to go to the assembly area.</p>

									  <p>As would anyone else, according to the rules of the Festival as laid
									    down by Nestir, who had not yet been sent to his Reward.</p>

									  <p>That would be a dangerous time. For then there would be no esthetic
									    consideration. It would be a fight amongst all assembling for the final
									    honor of Sole Survivor. One could expect no mercy: clean, quick sword
									    stroke, no more. No suffering at all.</p>

									  <p>It was not a pleasant prospect. But to be the coveted Sole Survivor
									    compensated for the risk.</p>

									  <p>The captain laid the sword across his lap and petted it.</p>

									  <p>He would fight. And no crew member need expect to be the man Cast Off
									    by the first mate; that was to be the captain's fate.</p>

									  <p>The second bell called to the ship shrilly.</p>

									  <p>The hunt was on!</p>

									  <hr class="tb">

									    <p>Martha and the first mate assembled the children in the large,
									      comfortable hospital. The steward's department had fixed them all a
									      lunch. The children were silent, for the angry brow of the first mate
									      was a complete damper on their usual animal spirits. There was no
									      holiday happiness.</p>

									    <p>The children moved around and fell into little, shifting groups.
									      Several of them began to game at marbles, but the first mate broke it
									      up before it degenerated into a fist fight.</p>

									    <p>"Well, there goes the hunting bell," Martha said.</p>

									    <p>"Yes," the mate said, "hit do, don't hit."</p>

									    <p>"I think they could have a regular nurse for this sort of thing,"
									      Martha said.</p>

									    <p>The mate grunted. "Humph. I shore hope they uns don't raise no ruckus.
									      I've got me a splittin' haidache."</p>

									    <p>"Shhhh. Listen. I thought I heard someone scream."</p>

									    <p>"Yep," the mate said. "I was sure afraid uv hit; won't be able to
									      heyar myself think all day long. I'm a-tellin' ya, Martha, if these
									      young uns start a-actin' up, too, I'm jest a-gonna take a knife an'
									      split this here haid open, Reward or no Reward."</p>

									    <p>"That's not a nice way to talk," Martha said.</p>

									    <p>"No, hit hain't. But I'm a-sayin' hit."</p>

									    <p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," Martha said. "I'll call all the children
									      together and tell them nursery stories. That oughta keep them quiet.
									      And you go over there and lay down where there won't be anyone to
									      bother you."</p>

									    <p>"All right, Martha, an' I shore do thankee."</p>

									    <p>The first mate made his way to the farthest bed, sat down, took off
									      his shoes, and stretched out on it. He reached up and felt his head
									      tenderly.</p>

									    <p>"Children," Martha called. "Oh, children! I want you all to come over
									      here."</p>

									    <p>Reluctantly, the children obeyed her.</p>

									    <p>"That's right," she said. "Now. You all sit down and make yourselves
									      comfortable, and be still as mice so my husband can sleep, and I'll
									      tell you stories. And then, after a while, we'll eat the nice lunch the
									      steward fixed for us, and we'll all have the bestest time."</p>

									    <p>"I don't like you," one of the little boys said.</p>

									    <p>"Little boy," Martha said, "I don't like you, either."</p>

									    <p>"Oh," the little boy said.</p>

									    <p>"Now," Martha said, "I'm going to tell you the wonderful story about a
									      very pretty Princess and a very pretty Prince: Once upon a time, there
									      was a land called Zont. It sank long ago under the big, salty sea of
									      Zub...."</p>

									    <p>"My name's Joey," the little boy said.</p>

									    <p>"Well, Joey," Martha said, "do you see that long, steel rod over there,
									      where we hang clothing from?"</p>

									    <p>"Uh-huh."</p>

									    <p>"If you don't shut your little mouth, I'll hang you on it by your
									      thumbs."</p>

									    <p>"Betcha ya won't," one of the little girls said.</p>

									    <hr class="tb">

									      <p>"Once upon a time," Martha said, "there was this handsome Prince and
										pretty Princess. But the father of the Princess, King Exaltanta, was a
										heathen and did not believe in the Prophet. Now. When a true believer,
										kind King Farko, captured King Exaltanta's kingdom, the deposed king
										hid his daughter in the deepest dungeon.</p>

									      <p>"Now when the fair Prince, who was the son of King Farko, and whose
										name was William, heard of the Princess in the dungeon, he decided that
										he would rescue her and marry her. And after she had had one child
										by him, the two of them would travel to the Holy City of Meizque to
										participate in the Changing of the Wives and the Festival there.</p>

									      <p>"Well, it so happened that King Farko got a special dispensation from
										the Great Priest to send the members of Exaltanta's family to their
										Reward without their consent. As he prepared the ceremonies—they were
										to be very simple: for, after all, the royal household members weren't
										true believers, and would consequently need to spend a million years
										(at least) as Outcasts before entering into their Reward, anyhow—as he
										prepared the ceremonies...."</p>

									      <p>"But does everyone get a Reward? Even people who don't believe?" a
										little girl asked, wide eyed.</p>

									      <p>"Nearly everyone, my child. The Prophet was not a cruel man. Of course,
										people who try to Cast themselves Off never, never, never get a Reward.
										But others, everybody else, all get theirs. It's only a question of how
										long they have to wait. Sometimes, as when they're unbelievers, it may
										be a long, long, long time, but...."</p>

									      <p>"I know that," Joey said.</p>

									      <p>Martha looked up at him and sighed; she stood up. "Come with me, dear,"
										she said.</p>

									      <p>At that moment, the door flew open with a loud bang.</p>

									      <p>The first mate, who had been asleep, sat bolt upright on the bed. "God
										damn hit!" he screamed. "My haid!"</p>

									      <p>"Oh," said a crew member, who was dragging a woman by the hair, "I'm
										terribly sorry. I didn't know you were in here. I just came in to Cast
										Mary Jane Off in privacy." He waved an odd-looking instrument at Martha
										by way of amplification.</p>

									      <p>"Hello, mummy," one of the smaller girls said to the woman.</p>

									      <p>"Oh, why, hello, honey. Are you having fun?"</p>

									      <p>"Oh, yes, mummy."</p>

									      <p>Mary Jane looked at the crewman. "Well, Bob," she said, "I guess we'll
										just have to go some place else."</p>

									      <p>"Well, git hout er come in, but shut that door! That noise out there is
										a-tearin' off my haid!"</p>

									      <p>The crewman called Bob dragged the woman called Mary Jane out of the
										room. She pulled the door closed behind her.</p>

									      <p>"Well, children," Martha said, "we ought to get back to my story. Now,
										King Farko, as you will remember, received a special dispensation...."</p>

									      <hr class="tb">

										<p>Nestir locked his door when the separation bell sounded.</p>

										<p>Having done that, he proceeded to fix himself a meal. It was a simple
										  one, consisting only of what material he had been able to steal from
										  the steward's department the previous night.</p>

										<p>As he ate, he reflected upon his course of action. It was, he could
										  see, going to be difficult to justify at the Reward. But he had been
										  a priest, and because of that he was reasonably well grounded in
										  theological dialectics.</p>

										<p>The Festival, of course, was a fine thing. But it had its weak points.
										  Chief among them being that the Casting Off was left to inexperienced
										  hands, and certainly, if there was ever a time when experience was
										  required, then the Casting Off was that time. One should be Cast Off at
										  leisure; suffering long and deliciously. A state hero, for instance,
										  honored by being Cast Off by one of the King's Guards, certainly died
										  the best death imaginable.</p>

										<p>In the present case, although the death as Sole Survivor was to come at
										  the hands of the first mate (who really lacked the training for such
										  a position of trust), it would be the best Casting Off available. For
										  the first mate could follow instructions, and Nestir had written the
										  instructions.</p>

										<p>Nestir intended to remain in the stateroom all day; the hunt would go
										  merrily along without him.</p>

										<p>When the assembly bell rang, he would still remain in his stateroom.</p>

										<p>Then, late at night, he would leave. He would slip down to the first
										  mate's stateroom and determine from him where the premature Sole
										  Survivor slept. Then he would find him and Cast him Off in his sleep.
										  And Nestir would be the actual Sole Survivor.</p>

										<p>Nestir could justify his conduct by virtue of the little known
										  theological clause: <i>ego bestum alpha todas</i>. A decision handed down by
										  the High Court of the Prophet (Malin vs the Estate of Kattoa: T &amp; C,
										  '98) nearly a hundred years previously.</p>

										<p>Nestir had, in his hip pocket, a small vial of slow-acting poison.
										  He would drink it just before Casting the man Off. Then were he not
										  handled the next day by the first mate, he would die the Outcast death,
										  by his own hand.</p>

										<p>He did not doubt his ability to convince Them at the Reward. It would
										  be difficult, but it was not beyond his ability. Certainly, if no one
										  took the opportunity of Casting him Off as he sat behind the locked
										  door of his room, it wasn't Nestir's fault.</p>

										<p>The bosun pushed the ventilator grill away and jumped out of the shaft
										  even before it hit the carpet.</p>

										<p>He landed catlike, his knees bending springily to absorb the shock. He
										  landed directly behind Nestir and pushed the little man against the
										  wall.</p>

										<p>Nestir struggled out of the wreckage of the chair.</p>

										<p>"How ... why ... why...?" he said.</p>

										<p>"Ah-ha," the bosun said. "Fooled ja, didn't I?"</p>

										<p>The bosun was carrying a thin rapier.</p>

										<p>"Let's discuss this," Nestir said. "One must go about these things
										  slowly."</p>

										<p>"Sorry," the bosun said.</p>

										<p>"My God," said Nestir, "you can't Cast me Off just like that: without
										  any suffering!"</p>

										<p>"Sorry," the bosun said. "Don't have all day. Spend all day with you,
										  and then what? The more people I can Cast Off before the assembly bell,
										  the better chance I'll have to be the Sole Survivor."</p>

										<p>"Have you no compassion, man? Can you turn aside from the course of the
										  gentle Prophet?"</p>

										<p>"Sorry," the bosun said again, sincerely. "I can't stand here all day
										  discussing it."</p>

										<p>"Ah, me," said Nestir as the bosun drew back from the thrust, "who
										  would have thought that I would be trapped by a religious fanatic?"</p>

										<p>"Must look out for myself, you know," said the bosun.</p>

										<hr class="chap">

										  <p class="ph4">IX</p>

										  <p>Helen said, "I thought maybe I hit you too hard."</p>

										  <p>"No," John said. "Fortunately not." He had just opened his eyes.</p>

										  <p>He was strapped tightly to the bed. "I appreciate what you're doing,"
										    he said. "I know you want to be sure I'm Cast Off right. But honey, do
										    you think it was fair to jump the bell on me like that?"</p>

										  <p>"Well," she said, "that's what you intended to do to the captain."</p>

										  <p>He grinned ruefully. "Darn it. I did look forward to Casting him Off."</p>

										  <p>"Oh, well," his wife said, "I guess we can't have everything."</p>

										  <p>"True, my dear," said John. "It was very thoughtful of you."</p>

										  <p>"I wanted to be sure that my husband had the best."</p>

										  <p>"I know you did."</p>

										  <p>"Well," she said. "I guess I may as well begin."</p>

										  <p>"Yes," he said.</p>

										  <p>"Have you any suggestions, honey?"</p>

										  <p>"No," he said. "I'll leave it all up to you."</p>

										  <p>"All right." She walked to the dresser and picked up a pair of pliers.
										    She crossed to him.</p>

										  <p>She had already removed his shoes while he was unconscious.</p>

										  <p>"I think," she said, "I'll take the big toe first."</p>

										  <p>"Whatever you like, my dear."</p>

										  <p>After a moment, she said, "My, I didn't know it was going to be so hard
										    to pull a few little old toenails."</p>

										  <p>After she had finished with his left foot, she poured alcohol over it.</p>

										  <p>Then she had to wait for him to regain consciousness.</p>

										  <p>"Honey?" she asked.</p>

										  <p>"Yes?"</p>

										  <p>"You didn't scream very much."</p>

										  <p>"That's all right," he said. "You're doing fine."</p>

										  <p>"All right," she said. "If you're satisfied. I guess I may as well
										    start on the other foot.... Oh, John?"</p>

										  <p>"Yes, dear?"</p>

										  <p>"Would you like for me to fix you a cup of tea before we go on?"</p>

										  <p>"I don't think so. But it's a nice thought."</p>

										  <p>"Honey?"</p>

										  <p>"Yes?"</p>

										  <p>"You asked what that fuel oil was for, remember?"</p>

										  <p>"Yes."</p>

										  <p>"Well, when I finish this," she said, "I'm going to pour it over you
										    and light it."</p>

										  <p>"Helen," he said, "I married one of the ... cleverest ... women ... in
										    the ... system."</p>

										  <p>"There," she said, "I thought I'd <i>never</i> get that one."</p>

										  <hr class="tb">

										    <p>The captain got very cramped, sitting there. It was late. He expected
										      it was about time for the assembly bell to ring.</p>

										    <p>He stood up.</p>

										    <p>No one had come down his corridor all day, and he felt very pleased
										      with his acumen in selecting it.</p>

										    <p>There wasn't nearly as much noise as there had been earlier; people
										      were thinning out. He hoped there wouldn't be many left in the fight
										      for the assembly.</p>

										    <p>He heard, interrupting his reverie, a thin, shrill shriek, drifting
										      down the corridor from his left. Then, looking, he saw a crewman
										      running toward him.</p>

										    <p>He tightened his grip on his infantry sword.</p>

										    <p>Then he relaxed. It was all right.</p>

										    <p>The man had no arms.</p>

										    <p>The crewman came to a stop in front of him.</p>

										    <p>"Oh? Captain. Good afternoon, sir."</p>

										    <p>"Good afternoon. Careful there. You'll get blood on my uniform."</p>

										    <p>"Sorry, sir."</p>

										    <p>"How are things going, back there?"</p>

										    <p>"Pretty slow ... last ... couple hours."</p>

										    <p>"Getting pretty weak, eh?"</p>

										    <p>"Yes, sir. Mind if ... I ... sit down?"</p>

										    <p>"Not at all. Make yourself at home."</p>

										    <p>"Thank ... you, sir." He sat down. "My," he said, "I'm tired."</p>

										    <p>"Loss of blood, probably. Listen, old fellow. Do you think you've about
										      quit suffering, now?"</p>

										    <p>"Oh, yes," the crewman said. "Scarcely feel ... a thing any more.
										      Numb."</p>

										    <p>"Well, in that case, no sense in keeping you from your Reward."</p>

										    <p>"Not ... a bit."</p>

										    <p>The captain drew back his huge sword.</p>

										    <p>"See ... you ... around," the crewman said.</p>

										    <p>The sword whistled down.</p>

										    <p>The captain wiped the sword on the crewman's blouse. His legs were
										      still stiff. He needed a little exercise. He began to walk toward the
										      dead end of the corridor, keeping a weather eye behind him.</p>

										    <p>"... Bombs away!"</p>

										    <p>The crewman hurtled onto his shoulders from the steampipe above.</p>

										    <p>The captain fell flat, and his sword went skittering away, rattling
										      loudly on the steel deck.</p>

										    <p>"Umph!" he said.</p>

										    <p>"Boy!" the crewman said, "I shore thought you'd <i>never</i> come back down
										      here."</p>

										    <p>The captain was stunned. He could feel the crewman lashing his hands
										      together behind him.</p>

										    <p>"What were you doing up there?" the captain said at length.</p>

										    <p>"I clumb up there when I a-hyeared ya a-comin' like a herd o'
										      elephants. I thought ta come down here an' wait hit out 'til th'
										      assembly bell."</p>

										    <p>"My intentions exactly," the captain said, testing his bonds. There
										      was no escape from them. "Your voice sounds familiar."</p>

										    <p>"Yeah. Hit should. I'm Henderson, th' officers' messman."</p>

										    <p>"Lord give me strength," the captain said.</p>

										    <p>"Now, iffen you'll jest roll over on yer back, Captain."</p>

										    <p>"What for, my boy?"</p>

										    <p>"I kinda thought that first off I'd like ta pour this little bottle of
										      hydrofluoric acid on ya."</p>

										    <p>"That's very clever," the captain said. Then he reconsidered. "For a
										      crewman, that is."</p>

										    <hr class="chap">

										      <p class="ph4">X</p>

										      <p>The first mate looked over at the bosun.</p>

										      <p>"Uncomfortable?"</p>

										      <p>"Yes," the bosun said.</p>

										      <p>"Fine, I thought you'd be." He took out his penknife and began to
											whittle on a piece of wood.</p>

										      <p>After a while he said, "You haint mindin' me puttin' hit off this away?"</p>

										      <p>"No," the bosun said, "suit yourself."</p>

										      <p>The first mate sent a shaving skittering with his knife blade.
											"Shucks," he said, "there hain't really no hurry."</p>

										      <p>The bosun raised his head from his chest and shook the hair out of his
											face. "Not really, when you consider it," he said.</p>

										      <p>"Yep, that's right." The first mate began to work on the point of the
											stick; he sharpened it down to needle fineness, and then he carefully
											cut in the barb. "Hain't very strong wood; them barbs are cut against
											the grain, an' they're liable ta split off when I try ta pull 'em out."</p>

										      <p>"I hope not," the bosun said.</p>

										      <p>The first mate said, "Yep, I'm shore afraid they're a-gonna do jest
											that little trick."</p>

										      <p>"Look," said the bosun, "this hair's gettin' in my eyes. I wunder if
											you'd mind kinda snippin' it off?"</p>

										      <p>"Not a-tall," the first mate said.</p>

										      <p>He walked over to the bosun, grabbed a handful of hair and sawed it off
											with the penknife.</p>

										      <p>"That better?"</p>

										      <p>"It shore is. Thanks."</p>

										      <p>"Not a-tall."</p>

										      <p>The first mate threw down the stick on the table. "Really should uv cut
											that before."</p>

										      <p>"I suppose so," the bosun said.</p>

										      <p>"'Course I warn't hable to see what uz in th' priest's mind."</p>

										      <p>"No, that's true," the bosun agreed.</p>

										      <p>The first mate walked over and picked up the typewritten instructions.</p>

										      <p>"You're a-gonna get a fine Castin' Off," he said.</p>

										      <p>"I should," the bosun said. "It ain't everybody can be th' Sole
											Survivor."</p>

										      <p>"That's true," the first mate said. "Well," he said after a minute, "I
											jest guess I know them there instructions fine as anything. I suspect
											we may as well start, iffen hits agreeable ta you."</p>

										      <p>"I'm ready," the bosun said.</p>

										      <p>The first mate took his penknife and tested the edge with his thumb.
											"Shore is sharp," he said. "Ought ta be. I jest got done a-honin' hit."</p>

										      <hr class="tb">

											<p>He walked over to where the bosun was hanging.</p>

											<p>"Well," he said. "No time like the present."</p>

											<p>He raised the knife.</p>

											<hr class="chap">

											      <p>"Jest a minute," he said. "I think I'll get me some music on the radio.
												You don't mind?"</p>

											      <p>"No," said the bosun. "Not a bit."</p>

											      <p>The first mate walked to the hyperspace radio and flicked on the dial.
												After fiddling with it for some time, he picked up a symphony being
												broadcast from Kque. "There," he said, "that's th' kind uv music I
												shore do like ta hear."</p>

											      <p>The music welled out and filled the room with sound.</p>

											      <p>"Shore is purty," the bosun said.</p>

											      <p>The first mate walked back to him.</p>

											      <p>"Guess I'll start on your back," he said. He reached up and ripped the
												bosun's shirt off.</p>

											      <p>Then, when the back was laid bare, he made a very shallow cut running
												the length of the shoulders from armpit to armpit.</p>

											      <p>"Be kinda hard ta get started," he said.</p>

											      <p>He put the penknife in the incision and began to pry the skin loose.
												"Gonna take me a long time ta get a hand holt," he said. "Course onct I
												do, hit'll be as easy as skinnin' a skunk."</p>

											      <p>"Take yer time," the bosun said.</p>

											      <p>"Aim to."</p>

											      <p>The music turned quiet and sounded of the rippling brooks on far
												Corazon; it reflected the vast meadows of Nid and the giant,
												silver-capped mountains of Muri. A cello picked up the theme and ran
												it, in rich notes, over the whole surface of the dead world, Astolath.
												A whining oboe piped of the sweet winds from Zoltah; and the brass beat
												out the finny rhythm of the water world of Du.</p>

											      <p>"'Scuse me," the first mate said. He laid down the penknife and walked
												to the radio. With a flick of his wrist, he cut it off.</p>

											      <p>"What uz th' matter with hit?" the bosun asked.</p>

											      <p>"Didn't ja notice?" said the first mate. "Th' third fiddle was sour."</p>

											      <p>"Guess I wasn't listenin' close enough," said the bosun.</p>

											      <p>The first mate returned to his work. "May as well get on with it," he
												said.</p>

											      <p>He raised the penknife again.</p>

											      <hr class="tb">

												<p>Martha threw the door open. "Here!" she said. She swung Joey around in
												  front of her by the left ear. "I'm going to have to leave him in here
												  with you, where he won't get into trouble."</p>

												<p>The first mate laid aside the penknife.</p>

												<p>"Martha," he said, "I jest plain don't like kids."</p>

												<p>"I'm sorry," she said, "But I just can't keep him with the rest of the
												  children. I just can't."</p>

												<p>"Whatud he do?" the bosun asked.</p>

												<p>"Do? Let me tell you," Martha said. "First, he...."</p>

												<p>"I didn't," Joey said.</p>

												<p>"I haint got no all day ta listen ta ya, woman," the first mate said.</p>

												<p>"Well. The worst of it was with little Jane. Do you know what he tried
												  to do to her?"</p>

												<p>"No, and I shore don't care," said the first mate testily.</p>

												<p>"Well, first he got her down under the table; and then he sat on her;
												  and if I hadn't stopped him, he would have pounded her brains out
												  against the deck."</p>

												<p>"My, my," said the bosun.</p>

												<p>"That hain't a-tall nice."</p>

												<p>"Grownups do it," Joey said.</p>

												<p>"That's entirely different," the bosun said.</p>

												<p>"No, it ain't. You just don't like me, that's all."</p>

												<p>"Little Jane wasn't ready," Martha said. "She hasn't had a chance to do
												  her duty."</p>

												<p>"It don't matter," Joey said.</p>

												<p>"Little boy," said the bosun, "do you know where people go who talk
												  that way?"</p>

												<p>"I don't care," Joey said.</p>

												<p>"You see? I'll simply have to leave him in here with you."</p>

												<p>"All right," the first mate agreed reluctantly. "Now, little boy," he
												  said, "you hain't a-gonna bother me, hear? I'm very busy. You jest go
												  over there and watch."</p>

												<p>"Yes," said the bosun.</p>

												<p>Martha said, "Well, I better get back to the other children."</p>

												<p>She left and the first mate turned back to his job.</p>

												<p>"What's he crying for?" Joey asked.</p>

												<p>"'Cause it hurts," the first mate explained.</p>

												<p>"You missed somethin' there in th' back," Joey said.</p>

												<p>"Why did you try to choke that little girl?" the mate asked.</p>

												<p>"'Cause I wanted to."</p>

												<p>"Well," the first mate said, "that's why I left that little patch o'
												  skin."</p>

												<p>"Oh," said Joey.</p>

												<p>He stood up and walked around the bosun.</p>

												<p>"What're ya gonna do next?" he asked.</p>

												<p>"Be still," said the bosun.</p>

												<p>"I bet I know," Joey said. "I'll bet you're gonna take that little
												  stick over there an' stick it in him."</p>

												<p>"That shore ... is right," the bosun said proudly.</p>

												<p>"Can I, huh?"</p>

												<p>"No," the first mate said.</p>

												<p>"Why not? All ya gotta do is...." He picked up the stick and lunged at
												  the bosun.</p>

												<hr class="tb">

												  <p>The first mate tripped him and took the stick away from him.</p>

												  <p>"Let him alone," the bosun said to Joey. "He's doin' jest fine."</p>

												  <p>"Thankee," said the first mate.</p>

												  <p>Martha came back.</p>

												  <p>"Is he bothering you? We could put him in the ice with the new crew,"
												    she said.</p>

												  <p>"Fine," the first mate said.</p>

												  <p>"Oh, no," Joey said. "You gotta catch me first." He began to back away
												    from Martha.</p>

												  <p>She took a step toward him.</p>

												  <p>He turned and started to run.</p>

												  <p>"Thought so," she said. She had been holding one hand behind her. It
												    contained a plastic ash-tray. She caught him squarely between the ears
												    with it, and he went down.</p>

												  <p>"Good heave, Martha!" the first mate said.</p>

												  <p>She walked over to Joey, picked him up and started to the door.</p>

												  <p>At the door she paused.</p>

												  <p>"What did you say you wanted for supper, Fontelroy?"</p>

												  <p>"Two aigs," he said.</p>

												    1.F.

												    1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
												    effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
												    public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
												    collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
												    works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
												    "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
												    corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
												    property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
												    computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
												    your equipment.

												    1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
												    of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
												    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

												    defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
												    receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
												    written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
												    received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
												    your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
												    the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
												    refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
												    providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
												    receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
												    is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further

												    warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
												    If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
												    law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
												    interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
												    the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
												    provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

												    1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
												    trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
												    providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
												    with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
												    promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
												    harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
												    that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
												    or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
												    work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
												    Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


												    Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

												    Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
												    electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
												    including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
												    because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
												    people in all walks of life.

												    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
												    assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
												    goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
												    remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
												    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
												    and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
												    To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
												    and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
												    and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

												    Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
												    Literary Archive Foundation

												    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
												    spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
												    increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
												    freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
												    array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
												    ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
												    status with the IRS.

												    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
												    charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
												    States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
												    considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
												    with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
												    where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
												    SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
												    particular state visit http://pglaf.org

												    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
												    have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
												    against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
												    approach us with offers to donate.

												    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
												    any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
												    outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

												    Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
												    methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
												    ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
												    To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


												    Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
												    works.

												    Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
												    concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
												    with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
												    Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


												    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
												    editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
												    unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
												    keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


												    Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

												    http://www.gutenberg.org

												    This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
												    including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
												    Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
												    subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
