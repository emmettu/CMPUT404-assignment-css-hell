	  <h1>A PLACE IN THE SUN</h1>

	  <p class="author">By C. H. THAMES</p>

	  <p class="blurb"><em>Mayhem, the man of many
	      bodies, had been given some
	      weird assignments in his time,
	      but saving The Glory of the
	      Galaxy wasn’t difficult—it
	      was downright impossible!</em></p>
	</div>

	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> SOS crackled and
	  hummed through subspace
	  at a speed which left
	  laggard light far behind. Since
	  subspace distances do not coincide
	  with normal space distances,
	  the SOS was first
	  picked up by a Fomalhautian
	  freighter bound for Capella
	  although it had been issued
	  from a point in normal space
	  midway between the orbit of
	  Mercury and the sun’s <ins title="original reads &#39;cornea&#39;">corona</ins>
	  in the solar system.</p>

	  </div>

	  <p>The radioman of the Fomalhautian
	    freighter gave the
	    distress signal to the Deck
	    Officer, who looked at it,
	    blinked, and bolted ’bove decks
	    to the captain’s cabin. His face
	    <!-- Original location of full-page illustration -->
	    <a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40">&nbsp;</a>was very white when he
	    reached the door and his heart
	    pounded with excitement. As
	    the Deck Officer crossed an
	    electronic beam before the
	    door a metallic voice said:
	    “The Captain is asleep and
	    will be disturbed for nothing
	    but emergency priority.”</p>

	  <p>Nodding, the Deck officer
	    stuck his thumb in the whorl-lock
	    of the door and entered
	    the cabin. “Begging your pardon,
	    sir,” he cried, “but we
	    just received an SOS from—”</p>

	  <hr class="thoughtbreak">

	    <p class="post_thoughtbreak">The Captain stirred groggily,
	      sat up, switched on a
	      green night light and squinted
	      through it at the Deck Officer.
	      “Well, what is it? Isn’t the
	      Eye working?”</p>

	    <p>“Yes, sir. An SOS, sir….”</p>

	    <p>“If we’re close enough to
	      help, subspace or normal
	      space, take the usual steps,
	      lieutenant. Surely you don’t
	      need me to—”</p>

	    <p>“The usual steps can’t be
	      taken, sir. Far as I can make
	      out, that ship is doomed. She’s
	      bound on collision course for
	      Sol, only twenty million miles
	      out now.”</p>

	    <p>“That’s too bad, lieutenant,”
	      the Captain said with
	      genuine sympathy in his voice.
	      “I’m sorry to hear that. But
	      what do you want me to do
	      about it?”</p>

	    <p>“The ship, sir. The ship that
	      sent the SOS—hold on to your
	      hat, sir—”</p>

	    <p>“Get to the point now, will
	      you, young man?” the Captain
	      growled sleepily.</p>

	    <p>“The ship which sent the
	      SOS signal, the ship heading
	      on collision course for Sol, is
	      the <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>!”</p>

	    <p>For a moment the Captain
	      said nothing. Distantly, you
	      could hear the hum of the subspace
	      drive-unit and the faint
	      whining of the stasis generator.
	      Then the Captain bolted
	      out of bed after unstrapping
	      himself. In his haste he forgot
	      the ship was in weightless
	      deep space and went sailing,
	      arms flailing air, across the
	      room. The lieutenant helped
	      him down and into his magnetic-soled
	      shoes.</p>

	    <p>“My God,” the Captain said
	      finally. “Why did it happen?
	      Why did it have to happen to
	      the <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>?”</p>

	    <p>“What are you going to do,
	      sir?”</p>

	    <p>“<em>I</em> can’t do anything. I won’t
	      take the responsibility. Have
	      the radioman contact the Hub
	      at once.”</p>

	    <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

	    <p><i>The Glory of the Galaxy</i>,
	      the SOS ship heading on collision
	      course with the sun, was
	      making its maiden run from
	      the assembly satellites of
	      Earth across the inner solar
	      system via the perihelion passage
	      <a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41">&nbsp;</a>which would bring it
	      within twenty-odd million
	      miles of the sun, to Mars
	      which now was on the opposite
	      side of Sol from Earth.
	      Aboard the gleaming new ship
	      was the President of the Galactic
	      Federation and his entire
	      cabinet.</p>

	    <hr class="thoughtbreak">

	      <p class="post_thoughtbreak">The Fomalhautian freighter’s
		emergency message was
		received at the Hub of the
		Galaxy within moments after
		it had been sent, although the
		normal space distance was in
		the neighborhood of one hundred
		thousand light years.
		The message was bounced—in
		amazingly quick time—from
		office to office at the hub,
		cutting through the usual red
		tape because of its top priority.
		And—since none of the
		normal agencies at the Hub
		could handle it—the message
		finally arrived at an office
		which very rarely received official
		messages of any kind.
		This was the one unofficial,
		extra-legal office at the Hub of
		the Galaxy. Lacking official
		function, the office had no
		technical existence and was
		not to be found in any Directory
		of the Hub. At the moment,
		two young men were
		seated inside. Their sole job
		was to maintain <ins title="original reads &#39;liason&#39;">liaison</ins> with
		a man whose very existence
		was doubted by most of the
		human inhabitants of the Galaxy
		but whose importance
		could not be measured by mere
		human standards in those early
		days when the Galactic
		League was becoming the Galactic
		Federation.</p>

	      <p>The name of the man with
		whom they maintained contact
		was Johnny Mayhem.</p>

	      <p>“Did you read it?” the blond
		man asked.</p>

	      <p>“I read it.”</p>

	      <p>“If it got down here, that
		means they can’t handle it
		anywhere else.”</p>

	      <p>“Of course they can’t. What
		the hell could normal slobs like
		them or like us do about it?”</p>

	      <p>“Nothing, I guess. But wait
		a minute! You don’t mean
		you’re going to send Mayhem,
		without asking him, without
		telling—”</p>

	      <p>“We can’t ask him now, can
		we?”</p>

	      <p>“Johnny Mayhem’s <em>elan</em> is
		at the moment speeding from
		Canopus to Deneb, where on
		the fourth planet of the Denebian
		system a dead body is
		waiting for him in cold
		storage. The turnover from
		League to Federation status
		of the Denebian system is
		causing trouble in Deneb City,
		so Mayhem—”</p>

	      <p>“Deneb City will probably
		survive without Mayhem.
		Well, won’t it?”</p>

	      <p>“I guess so, but—”</p>

	      <p><a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42">&nbsp;</a>“I know. The deal is we’re
		supposed to tell Mayhem
		where he’s going and what he
		can expect. The deal also is,
		every inhabited world has a
		body waiting for his <em>elan</em> in
		cold storage. But don’t you
		think if we could talk to Mayhem
		now—”</p>

	      <p>“It isn’t possible. He’s in
		transit.”</p>

	      <p>“Don’t you think if we could
		talk to him now he would
		agree to board the <em>Glory of
		  the Galaxy</em>?”</p>

	      <p>“How should I know? I’m
		not Johnny Mayhem.”</p>

	      <p>“If he doesn’t board her, it’s
		certain death for all of them.”</p>

	      <p>“And if he does board her,
		what the hell can he do about
		it? Besides, there isn’t any
		dead body awaiting his <em>elan</em>
		on that ship or any ship. He
		wouldn’t make a very efficacious
		ghost.”</p>

	      <p>“But there are live people.
		Scores of them. Mayhem’s <em>elan</em>
		is quite capable of possessing
		a living host.”</p>

	      <p>“Sure. Theoretically it is.
		But damn it all, what would
		the results be? We’ve never
		tried it. It’s liable to damage
		Mayhem. As for the host—”</p>

	      <p>“The host might die. I know
		it. But he’ll die anyway. The
		whole shipload of them is
		heading on collision course for
		the sun.”</p>

	      <p>“Does the SOS say why?”</p>

	      <p>“No. Maybe Mayhem can
		find out and do something
		about it.”</p>

	      <hr class="thoughtbreak">

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak">“Yeah, maybe. That’s a hell
		  of a way to risk the life of
		  the most important man in the
		  Galaxy. Because if Mayhem
		  boards that ship and can’t do
		  anything about it, he’ll die
		  with the rest of them.”</p>

		<p>“Why? We could always
		  pluck his <em>elan</em> out again.”</p>

		<p>“<em>If</em> he were inhabiting a
		  dead one. In a live body, I
		  don’t think so. The attraction
		  would be stronger. There
		  would be forces of cohesion—”</p>

		<p>“That’s true. Still, Mayhem’s
		  our only hope.”</p>

		<p>“I’ll admit it’s a job for
		  Mayhem, but he’s too important.”</p>

		<p>“Is he? Don’t be a fool.
		  What, actually, is Johnny
		  Mayhem’s importance? His
		  importance lies in the very
		  fact that he is expendable. His
		  life—for the furtherance of
		  the new Galactic Federation.”</p>

		<p>“But—”</p>

		<p>“And the President is
		  aboard that ship. Maybe he
		  can’t do as much for the Galaxy
		  in the long run as Mayhem
		  can, but don’t you see,
		  man, he’s a figurehead. Right
		  now he’s the most important
		  man in the Galaxy, and if we
		  could talk to him I’m sure
		  <a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43">&nbsp;</a>Mayhem would agree. Mayhem
		  would want to board that
		  ship.”</p>

		<p>“It’s funny, we’ve been
		  working with Mayhem all
		  these years and we never even
		  met the guy.”</p>

		<p>“Would you know him if
		  you saw him?”</p>

		<p>“Umm-mm, I guess not. Do
		  you think we really can halt
		  his <em>elan</em> in subspace and divert
		  it over to the <em>Glory of the
		    Galaxy</em>?”</p>

		<p>“I take it you’re beginning
		  to see things my way. And the
		  answer to your question is
		  yes.”</p>

		<p>“Poor Mayhem. You know,
		  I actually feel sorry for the
		  guy. He’s had more adventures
		  than anyone since
		  Homer wrote the <i>Odyssey</i> and
		  there won’t ever be any rest
		  for him.”</p>

		<p>“Stop feeling sorry for him
		  and start hoping he succeeds.”</p>

		<p>“Yeah.”</p>

		<p>“And let’s see about getting
		  a <ins title="original was italicized">bead</ins> on his <ins title="original was not italicized"><em>elan</em></ins>.”</p>

		<p>The two young men walked
		  to a tri-dim chart which took
		  up much of the room. One of
		  them touched a button and
		  blue light glowed within the
		  chart, pulsing brightly and
		  sharply where space-sectors
		  intersected.</p>

		<p>“He’s in C-17 now,” one of
		  the men said as a gleaming
		  whiteness was suddenly superimposed
		  at a single point
		  on the blue.</p>

		<p>“Can you bead him?”</p>

		<p>“I think so. But I still feel
		  sorry for Mayhem. He’s expecting
		  to wake up in a cold-storage
		  corpse on Deneb IV
		  but instead he’ll come to in a
		  living body aboard a spaceship
		  on collision course for the
		  sun.”</p>

		<p>“Just hope he—”</p>

		<p>“I know. Succeeds. I don’t
		  even want to think of the possibility
		  he might fail.”</p>

		<p>In seconds, the gleaming
		  white dot crawled across the
		  surface of the tri-dim chart
		  from sector C-17 to sector S-1.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak">

		  <p class="post_thoughtbreak">The <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>
		    was now nineteen million
		    miles out from the sun and
		    rushing through space at a
		    hundred miles per second, normal
		    space drive. The <em>Glory of
		      the Galaxy</em> thus moved a million
		    miles closer to fiery destruction
		    every three hours—but
		    since the sun’s gravitational
		    force had to be added
		    to that speed, the ship was
		    slated to plunge into the sun’s
		    <ins title="original reads &#39;cornea&#39;">corona</ins> in little more than
		    twenty-four hours.</p>

		  <p>Since the ship’s refrigeration
		    units would function perfectly
		    until the outer hull
		    reached a temperature of
		    eleven hundred degrees Fahrenheit,
		    none of its passengers
		    <a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44">&nbsp;</a>knew that anything was
		    wrong. Even the members of
		    the crew went through all the
		    normal motions. Only the
		    <i>Glory of the Galaxy’s</i> officers
		    in their bright new uniforms
		    and gold braid knew the grim
		    truth of what awaited the
		    gleaming two-thousand ton
		    spaceship less than twenty-four
		    hours away at the exact
		    center of its perihelion
		    passage.</p>

		  <p>Something—unidentified as
		    yet—in all the thousands of
		    intricate things that could go
		    wrong on a spaceship, particularly
		    a new one making its
		    maiden voyage, had gone
		    wrong. The officers were
		    checking their catalogues and
		    their various areas of watch
		    meticulously—and not because
		    their own lives were at stake.
		    In spaceflight, your own life
		    always is at stake. There are
		    too many imponderables: you
		    are, to a certain degree, expendable.
		    The commissioned
		    contingent aboard the <em>Glory
		      of the Galaxy</em> was a dedicated
		    group, hand-picked from all
		    the officers in the solar system.</p>

		  <hr class="thoughtbreak">

		    <p class="post_thoughtbreak">But they could find nothing.
		      And do nothing.</p>

		    <p>Within a day, their lives
		      along with the lives of the enlisted
		      men aboard the <em>Glory of
			the Galaxy</em> and the passengers
		      on its maiden run, would be
		      snuffed out in a brilliant burst
		      of solar heat.</p>

		    <p>And the President of the
		      Galactic Federation would die
		      because some unknown factor
		      had locked the controls of the
		      spaceship, making it impossible
		      to turn or use forward
		      rockets against the gravitational
		      pull of the sun.</p>

		    <p>Nineteen million miles. In
		      normal space, a considerable
		      distance. A hundred miles a
		      second—a very considerable
		      normal space speed. Increasing….</p>

		    <hr class="thoughtbreak">

		      <p class="post_thoughtbreak">Ever since they had left
			Earth’s assembly satellites,
			Sheila Kelly had seen a lot of
			a Secret Serviceman named
			Larry Grange, who was a
			member of the President’s
			corps of bodyguards. She liked
			Larry, although there was
			nothing serious in their relationship.
			He was handsome
			and charming and she was
			naturally flattered with his attentions.
			Still, although he
			was older than Sheila, she
			sensed that he was a boy
			rather than a man and had
			the odd feeling that, faced
			with a real crisis, he would
			confirm this tragically.</p>

		      <p>It was night aboard the
			<i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>. Which
			was to say the blue-green
			night lights had replaced the
			white day lights in the companionways
			<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45">&nbsp;</a>and public rooms
			of the spaceship, since its
			ports were sealed against the
			fierce glare of the sun. It was
			hard to believe, Sheila
			thought, that they were only
			nineteen million miles from
			the sun. Everything was so
			cool—so comfortably air-conditioned….</p>

		      <p>She met Larry in the Sunside
			Lounge, a cabaret as nice
			as any terran nightclub she
			had ever seen. There were
			stylistic Zodiac drawings on
			the walls and blue-mirrored
			columns supporting the roof.
			Like everything else aboard
			the <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>, the
			Sunside Lounge hardly
			seemed to belong on a spaceship.
			For Sheila Kelly, though—herself
			a third secretary
			with the department of Galactic
			Economy—it was all very
			thrilling.</p>

		      <p>“Hello, Larry,” she said as
			the Secret Serviceman joined
			her at their table. He was a
			tall young man in his late
			twenties with crewcut blond
			hair; but he sat down heavily
			now and did not offer Sheila
			his usual smile.</p>

		      <p>“Why, what on earth is the
			matter?” Sheila asked him.</p>

		      <p>“Nothing. I need a drink,
			that’s all.”</p>

		      <p>The drinks came. Larry
			gulped his and ordered another.
			His complete silence
			baffled Sheila, who finally
			said:</p>

		      <p>“Surely it isn’t anything I
			did.”</p>

		      <p>“You? Don’t be silly.”</p>

		      <p>“Well! After the way you
			said that I don’t know if I
			should be glad or not.”</p>

		      <p>“Just forget it. I’m sorry,
			kid. I—” He reached out and
			touched her hand. His own
			hand was damp and cold.</p>

		      <p>“Going to tell me, Larry?”</p>

		      <p>“Listen. What’s a guy supposed
			to do if he overhears
			something he’s not supposed
			to overhear, and—”</p>

		      <p>“How should I know unless
			you tell me what you overheard?
			It is you you’re talking
			about, isn’t it?”</p>

		      <p>“Yeah. I was going off duty,
			walking by officer quarters
			and … oh, forget it. I better
			not tell you.”</p>

		      <p>“I’m a good listener,
			Larry.”</p>

		      <p>“Look, Irish. You’re a good
			anything—and that’s the
			truth. You have looks and you
			have brains and I have a
			hunch through all that Emerald
			Isle sauciness you have a
			heart too. But—”</p>

		      <p>“But you don’t want to tell
			me.”</p>

		      <p>“It isn’t I don’t want to, but
			no one’s supposed to know, not
			even the President.”</p>

		      <p>“You sure make it sound
			mysterious.”</p>

		      <p><a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46">&nbsp;</a>“Just the officers. Oh, hell.
			I don’t know. What good
			would it do if I told you?”</p>

		      <p>“I guess you’d just get it off
			your chest, that’s all.”</p>

		      <p>“I can’t tell anyone official,
			Sheila. I’d have my head
			handed to me. But I’ve got to
			think and I’ve got to tell someone.
			I’ll go crazy, just knowing
			and not doing anything.”</p>

		      <p>“It’s important, isn’t it?”</p>

		      <hr class="thoughtbreak">

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Larry downed another
			  drink quickly. It was his
			  fourth and Sheila had never
			  seen him take more than three
			  or four in the course of
			  a whole evening. “You’re
			  damned right it’s important.”
			  Larry leaned forward across
			  the postage-stamp table. A
			  liquor-haze clouded his eyes as
			  he said: “It’s so important
			  that unless someone does
			  something about it, we’ll all be
			  dead inside of twenty-four
			  hours. Only trouble is, there
			  isn’t anything anyone can do
			  about it.”</p>

			<p>“Larry—you’re a little
			  drunk.”</p>

			<p>“I know it. I know I am. I
			  want to be a lot drunker. What
			  the hell can a guy do?”</p>

			<p>“What do you know, Larry?
			  What have you heard?”</p>

			<p>“I know they have the President
			  of the Galactic Federation
			  aboard this ship and that
			  he ought to be told the truth.”</p>

			<p>“No. I mean—”</p>

			<p>“They sent out an SOS, kid.
			  Controls are locked. Lifeboats
			  don’t have enough power to
			  get us out of the sun’s gravitational
			  pull. We’re all going
			  to roast, I tell you!”</p>

			<p>Sheila felt her heart throb
			  wildly. Even though he was
			  well on the way to being thoroughly
			  drunk, Larry was telling
			  the truth. Instinctively,
			  she knew that—was certain
			  of it. “What are you going to
			  do?” she said.</p>

			<p>He shrugged. “I guess because
			  I can’t do a damned
			  thing I’m going to get good
			  and drunk. That’s what I’m
			  going to do. Or maybe—who
			  the hell knows?—maybe in
			  one minute I’m going to jump
			  up on this table and tell everyone
			  what I overheard. Maybe
			  I ought to do that, huh?”</p>

			<p>“Larry, Larry—if it’s as
			  bad as you say, maybe you
			  ought to think before you do
			  anything.”</p>

			<p>“Who am I to think? I’m
			  one of the muscle men. That’s
			  what they pay me for, isn’t
			  it?”</p>

			<p>“Larry. You don’t have to
			  shout.”</p>

			<p>“Well, isn’t it?”</p>

			<p>“If you don’t calm down I’ll
			  have to leave.”</p>

			<p>“You can sit still. You can
			  park here all night. <em>I’m</em> leaving.”</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47">&nbsp;</a>“What are you going to
			  do?”</p>

			<p>“Oh … that.” Larry got up
			  from the table. He looked suddenly
			  green and Sheila
			  thought it was because he had
			  too much to drink. “You don’t
			  have to worry about that,
			  Sheila. Not now you don’t. I
			  all of a sudden don’t feel so
			  good. Headache. Man, I never
			  felt anything like it. Better go
			  to my cabin and lie down.
			  Maybe I’ll wake up and find
			  out all this was a dream,
			  huh?”</p>

			<p>“Do you need any help?”
			  Sheila demanded, real concern
			  in her voice.</p>

			<p>“No. ’Sall right. Man, this
			  headache really snuck up on
			  me. Pow! Without any warning.”</p>

			<p>“Let me help you.”</p>

			<p>“No. Just leave me alone,
			  will you?” Larry staggered off
			  across the crowded dance
			  floor. He drew angry glances
			  and muttered comments as he
			  disturbed the dancers waltzing
			  to Carlotti’s <em>Danube in
			    Space</em>.</p>

			<p>Why don’t you admit it,
			  Grange, Larry thought as he
			  staggered through the companionway
			  toward his cabin.
			  That’s what you always wanted,
			  isn’t it—a place of importance?</p>

			<p>A place in the sun, they call
			  it.</p>

			<p>“You’re going to get a place
			  in the sun, all right,” he
			  mumbled aloud. “Right smack
			  in the middle of the sun with
			  everyone else aboard this
			  ship!”</p>

			<p>The humor of it amused him
			  perversely. He smiled—but it
			  was closer to a leer—and
			  lunged into his cabin. What he
			  said to Sheila was no joke. He
			  really did have a splitting
			  headache. It had come on suddenly
			  and it was like no headache
			  he had ever known. It
			  pulsed and throbbed and beat
			  against his temples and held
			  red hot needles to the backs of
			  his eyeballs, almost blinding
			  him. It sapped all his strength,
			  leaving him physically weak.
			  He was barely able to close
			  the door behind him and stagger
			  to the shower.</p>

			<p>An ice cold shower, he
			  thought would help. He
			  stripped quickly and got under
			  the needle spray. By that
			  time he was so weak he could
			  barely stand.</p>

			<p>A place in the sun, he
			  thought….</p>

			<p>Something grabbed his
			  mind and wrenched it.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak">

			  <p class="post_thoughtbreak">Johnny Mayhem awoke.</p>

			  <p>Awakening came slowly, as
			    it always did. It was a rising
			    through infinite gulfs, a rebirth
			    for a man who had died
			    a hundred times and might die
			    <a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48">&nbsp;</a>a thousand times more as the
			    years piled up and became
			    centuries. It was a spinning,
			    whirling, flashing ascent from
			    blackness to coruscating colors,
			    brightness, giddiness.</p>

			  <p>And suddenly, it was over.</p>

			  <p>A needle spray of ice-cold
			    water beat down upon him.
			    He shuddered and reached for
			    the water-taps, shutting them.
			    Dripping, he climbed from the
			    shower.</p>

			  <p>And floated up—quite
			    weightless—toward the ceiling.</p>

			  <p>Frowning with his new and
			    as yet unseen face, Johnny
			    Mayhem propelled himself to
			    the floor. He looked at his
			    arms. He was naked—at least
			    that much was right.</p>

			  <p>But obviously, since he was
			    weightless, he was not on
			    Deneb IV. During his transmigration
			    he had been briefed
			    for the trouble on Deneb IV.
			    Then had a mistake been made
			    somehow? It was always possible—but
			    it had never happened
			    before.</p>

			  <p>Too much precision and
			    careful planning was involved.</p>

			  <p>Every world which had an
			    Earthman population and a
			    Galactic League—now, Galactic
			    Federation—post, must
			    have a body in cold storage,
			    waiting for Johnny Mayhem
			    if his services were required.
			    No one knew when Mayhem’s
			    services might be required. No
			    one knew exactly under what
			    circumstances the Galactic
			    Federation Council, operating
			    from the Hub of the Galaxy,
			    might summon Mayhem. And
			    only a very few people, including
			    those at the Hub and the
			    Galactic League Firstmen on
			    civilized worlds and Observers
			    on frontier planets, knew the
			    precise mechanics of Mayhem’s
			    coming.</p>

			  <hr class="thoughtbreak">

			    <p class="post_thoughtbreak">Johnny Mayhem, a bodiless
			      sentience. Mayhem—Johnny
			      Marlow then—who had been
			      chased from Earth a pariah
			      and a criminal seven years
			      ago, who had been mortally
			      wounded on a wild planet
			      deep within the Sagittarian
			      Swarm, whose life had been
			      saved—after a fashion—by
			      the white magic of that
			      planet. Mayhem, doomed now
			      to possible immortality as a
			      bodiless sentience, an <em>elan</em>,
			      which could occupy and activate
			      a corpse if it had been
			      preserved properly … an <em>elan</em>
			      doomed to wander eternally
			      because it could not remain in
			      one body for more than a
			      month without body and <em>elan</em>
			      perishing. Mayhem, who had
			      dedicated his strange, lonely
			      life to the services of the Galactic
			      League—now the Galactic
			      Federation—because a
			      normal life and normal social
			      <a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49">&nbsp;</a>relations were not possible to
			      him….</p>

			    <p>It did not seem possible,
			      Mayhem thought now, that a
			      mistake could be made. Then—a
			      sudden change in plans?</p>

			    <p>It had never happened before,
			      but it was entirely possible.
			      Something, Mayhem
			      decided, had come up during
			      transmigration. It was terribly
			      important and the people
			      at the Hub had had no opportunity
			      to brief him on it.</p>

			    <p>But—what?</p>

			    <hr class="thoughtbreak">

			      <p class="post_thoughtbreak">His first shock came a moment
				later. He walked to a
				mirror on the wall and approved
				of the strong young
				body which would house his
				sentience and then scowled. A
				thought inside his head said:</p>

			      <p><em>So this is what it’s like to
				  have schizophrenia.</em></p>

			      <p><em>What the hell was that?</em>
				Mayhem thought.</p>

			      <p><em>I said, so this is what it’s
				  like to have schizophrenia.
				  First the world’s worst headache
				  and then I start thinking
				  like two different people.</em></p>

			      <p><em>Aren’t you dead?</em></p>

			      <p><em>Is that supposed to be a
				  joke, alter ego? When do the
				  men in the white suits come?</em></p>

			      <p><em>Good Lord, this was supposed
				  to be a dead body!</em></p>

			      <p>At that, the other sentience
				which shared the body with
				Mayhem snickered and lapsed
				into silence. Mayhem, for his
				part, was astounded.</p>

			      <p><em>Don’t get ornery now</em>, Mayhem
				pleaded. <em>I’m Johnny
				  Mayhem. Does that mean anything
				  to you?</em></p>

			      <p><em>Oh, sure. It means I’m dead.
				  You inhabit dead bodies,
				  right?</em></p>

			      <p><em>Usually. Listen—where are
				  we?</em></p>

			      <p><em><i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>—bound
				  from Earth to Mars on perihelion.</em></p>

			      <p><em>And there’s trouble?</em></p>

			      <p><em>How do you know there’s
				  trouble?</em></p>

			      <p><em>Otherwise they wouldn’t
				  have diverted me here.</em></p>

			      <p><em>We’ve got the president
				  aboard. We’re going to hit the
				  sun.</em> Then, grudgingly, Larry
				went into the details. When he
				finished he thought cynically:
				<em>Now all you have to do is go
				  outside yelling have no fear,
				  Mayhem is here and everything
				  will be all right, I suppose.</em></p>

			      <p>Mayhem didn’t answer. It
				would be many moments yet
				before he could adjust to this
				new, unexpected situation.
				But in a way, he thought, it
				would be a boon. If he were
				co-inhabiting the body of a
				living man who belonged on
				the <em>Glory of the Galaxy</em>, there
				was no need to reveal his identity
				as Johnny Mayhem to
				anyone but his host….</p>

			      <hr class="thoughtbreak">

				<p class="post_thoughtbreak"><a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50">&nbsp;</a>“I tell ya,” Technician First
				  Class Ackerman Boone shouted,
				  “the refrigeration unit’s
				  gone on the blink. You can’t
				  feel it yet, but I ought to
				  know. I got the refrigs working
				  full strength and we
				  gained a couple of degrees
				  heat. Either she’s on the blink
				  or we’re too close to the sun,
				  I tell you!”</p>

				<p>Ackerman Boone was a big
				  man, a veteran spacer with a
				  squat, very strong body and
				  arms like an orangutan. Under
				  normal circumstances he
				  was a very fine spacer and a
				  good addition to any crew, but
				  he bore an unreasonable
				  grudge against the officer
				  corps and would go out of his
				  way to make them look bad in
				  the eyes of the other enlisted
				  men. A large crowd had gathered
				  in the hammock-hung
				  crew quarters of the <em>Glory of
				    the Galaxy</em> as Boone went on
				  in his deep, booming voice:
				  “So I asked the skipper of the
				  watch, I did. He got shifty-eyed,
				  like they always do. You
				  know. He wasn’t talking, but
				  sure as my name’s Ackerman
				  Boone, something’s wrong.”</p>

				<p>“What do you think it is,
				  Acky?” one of the younger
				  men asked.</p>

				<p>“Well, I tell ya this: I know
				  what it <em>isn’t</em>. I checked out the
				  refrigs three times, see, and
				  came up with nothing. The refrigs
				  are in jig order, and if
				  I know it then you know it. So,
				  if the refrigs are in jig order,
				  there’s only one thing it can
				  be: we’re getting too near the
				  sun!” Boone clamped his
				  mouth shut and stood with
				  thick, muscular arms crossed
				  over his barrel chest.</p>

				<hr class="thoughtbreak">

				  <p class="post_thoughtbreak">A young technician third
				    class said in a strident voice,
				    “You mean you think maybe
				    we’re plunging into the sun,
				    Acky?”</p>

				  <p>“Well, now, I didn’t say
				    that. Did I, boy? But we <em>are</em>
				    too close and if we are too
				    close there’s got to be a reason
				    for it. If we stay too close too
				    long, O.K. Then we’re plunging
				    into the sun. Right now, I
				    dunno.”</p>

				  <p>They all asked Ackerman
				    Boone, who was an unofficial
				    leader among them, what he
				    was going to do. He rubbed
				    his big fingers against the
				    thick stubble of beard on his
				    jaw and you could hear the
				    rasping sound it made. Then
				    he said, “Nothing, until we
				    find out for sure. But I got a
				    hunch the officers are trying
				    to pull the wool over the eyes
				    of them politicians we got on
				    board. That’s all right with
				    me, men. If they want to, they
				    got their reasons. But I tell
				    ya this: they ain’t going to
				    pull any wool over Acky
				    <a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51">&nbsp;</a>Boone’s eyes, and that’s a
				    fact.”</p>

				  <p>Just then the squawk box
				    called: “Now hear this! Now
				    hear this! Tech/1 Ackerman
				    Boone to Exec’s office. Tech/1
				    Boone to Exec.”</p>

				  <p>“You see?” Boone said,
				    smiling grimly. As yet, no one
				    saw. His face still set in a
				    grim smile, Ackerman Boone
				    headed above decks.</p>

				  <hr class="thoughtbreak">

				    <p class="post_thoughtbreak">“That, Mr. President,” Vice
				      Admiral T. Shawnley Stapleton
				      said gravely, “is the
				      problem. We would have come
				      to you sooner, sir, but
				      frankly—”</p>

				    <p>“I know it, Admiral,” the
				      President said quietly. “I
				      could not have helped you in
				      any way. There was no sense
				      telling me.”</p>

				    <p>“We have one chance, sir,
				      and one only. It’s irregular
				      and it will probably knock the
				      hell out of the <em>Glory of the
					Galaxy</em>, but it may save our
				      lives. If we throw the ship
				      suddenly into subspace we
				      could pass right through the
				      sun’s position and—”</p>

				    <p>“I’m no scientist, Admiral,
				      but wouldn’t that put tremendous
				      stress not only on the
				      ship but on all of us aboard?”</p>

				    <p>“It would, sir. I won’t keep
				      anything from you, of course.
				      We’d all be subjected to a
				      force of twenty-some gravities
				      for a period of several seconds.
				      Here aboard the <i>Glory</i>,
				      we don’t have adequate G-equipment.
				      It’s something like
				      the old days of air flight, sir:
				      as soon as airplanes became
				      reasonably safe, passenger
				      ships didn’t bother to carry
				      parachutes. Result over a
				      period of fifty years: thousands
				      of lives lost. We’d all be
				      bruised and battered, sir.
				      Bones would be broken. There
				      might be a few deaths. But I
				      see no other way out, sir.”</p>

				    <p>“Then there was no need to
				      check with me at all, I assure
				      you, Admiral Stapleton. Do
				      whatever you think is best,
				      sir.”</p>

				    <p>The Admiral nodded gravely.
				      “Thank you, Mr. President.
				      I will say this, though: we will
				      wait for a miracle.”</p>

				    <p>“I’m afraid I don’t follow
				      you.”</p>

				    <p>“Well, I don’t expect a miracle,
				      but the switchover to subspace
				      so suddenly is bound to
				      be dangerous. Therefore, we’ll
				      wait until the last possible
				      moment. It will grow uncomfortably
				      warm, let me warn
				      you, but as long as the subspace
				      drive is in good working
				      order—”</p>

				    <p>“I see what you mean, Admiral.
				      You have a free hand,
				      sir; let me repeat that. I will
				      not interfere in any way and
				      I have the utmost confidence
				      <a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52">&nbsp;</a>in you.” The President mopped
				      his brow with an already
				      damp handkerchief. It <em>was</em>
				      growing warm, come to think
				      of it. Uncomfortably warm.</p>

				    <p>As if everyone aboard the
				      <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i> was slowly
				      being broiled alive….</p>

				    <hr class="thoughtbreak">

				      <p class="post_thoughtbreak">Ackerman Boone entered
					the crew quarters with the
					same smile still on his lips. At
					first he said nothing, but his
					silence drew the men like a
					magnet draws iron filings.
					When they had all clustered
					about him he spoke.</p>

				      <p>“The Exec not only chewed
					my ears off,” he boomed. “He
					all but spit them in my face!
					I was right, men. He admitted
					it to me after he saw how he
					couldn’t get away with anything
					in front of Ackerman
					Boone. Men, we’re heading on
					collision course with the sun!”</p>

				      <p>A shocked silence greeted
					his words and Ackerman
					Boone, instinctively a born
					speaker, paused dramatically
					to allow each man the private
					horror of his own thoughts for
					a few moments. Then he continued:
					“The Admiral figures
					we have one chance to get
					out of this alive, men. He
					figures—”</p>

				      <p>“What is it, Acky?”</p>

				      <p>“What will he do?”</p>

				      <p>“How will the Admiral get
					us out of this?”</p>

				      <p>Ackerman Boone spat on
					the polished, gleaming floor of
					the crew quarters. “He’ll
					never get us out alive, let me
					tell you. He wants to shift us
					into subspace at the last possible
					minute. Suddenly. Like
					this—” and Ackerman Boone
					snapped his fingers.</p>

				      <p>“There’d be a ship full of
					broken bones!” someone protested.
					“We can’t do a thing
					like that.”</p>

				      <p>“He’ll kill us all!” a very
					young T/3 cried hysterically.</p>

				      <p>“Not if I can help it, he
					won’t,” shouted Ackerman
					Boone. “Listen, men. This
					ain’t a question of discipline.
					It’s a question of living or dying
					and I tell you that’s more
					important than doing it like
					the book says or discipline or
					anything like that. We got a
					chance, all right: but it ain’t
					what the Admiral thinks it is.
					We ought to abandon the
					<i>Glory</i> to her place in the sun
					and scram out of here in the
					lifeboats—every last person
					aboard ship.”</p>

				      <p>“But will they have enough
					power to get out of the sun’s
					gravitational pull?” someone
					asked.</p>

				      <p>Ackerman Boone shrugged.
					“Don’t look at me,” he said
					mockingly. “I’m only an enlisted
					man and they don’t give
					enlisted men enough math to
					answer questions like that.
					<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53">&nbsp;</a>But reckoning by the seat of
					my pants I would say, yes.
					Yes, we could get away like
					that—if we act fast. Because
					every minute we waste is a
					minute that brings us closer
					to the sun and makes it harder
					to get away in the lifeboats. If
					we act, men, we got to act
					fast.”</p>

				      <p>“You’re talking mutiny,
					Boone,” a grizzled old space
					veteran said. “You can count
					me out.”</p>

				      <p>“What’s the matter, McCormick?
					Yellow?”</p>

				      <p>“I’m not yellow. I say it
					takes guts to maintain discipline
					in a real emergency. I say
					<em>you’re</em> yellow, Boone.”</p>

				      <p>“You better be ready to
					back that up with your fists,
					McCormick,” Boone said
					savagely.</p>

				      <p>“I’m ready any time you’re
					ready, you yellow mutinous
					bastard!”</p>

				      <hr class="thoughtbreak">

					<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Ackerman Boone launched
					  himself at the smaller, older
					  man, who stood his ground
					  unflinchingly although he
					  probably knew he would take
					  a sound beating. But four or
					  five crewmen came between
					  them and held them apart, one
					  saying:</p>

					<p>“Look who’s talking, Boone.
					  You say time’s precious but
					  you’re all set to start fighting.
					  Every minute—”</p>

					<p>“Every <em>second</em>,” Boone said
					  grimly, “brings us more than
					  a hundred miles closer to the
					  sun.”</p>

					<p>“What can we do, Acky?”</p>

					<p>Instead of answer, Ackerman
					  Boone dramatically mopped
					  the sweat from his face.
					  All the men were uncomfortably
					  warm now. It was obvious
					  that the temperature
					  within the <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>
					  had now climbed fifteen or
					  twenty degrees despite the
					  fact that the refrigs were
					  working at full capacity. Even
					  the bulkheads and the metal
					  floor of crew quarters were
					  unpleasantly warm to the
					  touch. The air was hot and
					  suddenly very dry.</p>

					<p>“I’ll tell you what we ought
					  to do,” Ackerman Boone said
					  finally. “Admiral Stapleton or
					  no Admiral Stapleton, President
					  of the Galactic Federation
					  or no President of the
					  Galactic Federation, we ought
					  to take over this ship and man
					  the life boats for everyone’s
					  good. If they don’t want to
					  save their lives and ours—let’s
					  us save our lives and theirs!”</p>

					<p>Roars of approval greeted
					  Boone’s words, but Spacer
					  McCormick and some of the
					  other veterans stood apart
					  from the loud speech-making
					  which followed. Actually,
					  Boone’s wild words—which he
					  gambled with after the first
					  <a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54">&nbsp;</a>flush of enthusiasm for his
					  plan—began to lose converts.
					  One by one the men drifted
					  toward McCormick’s silent
					  group until, finally, Boone had
					  lost almost his entire audience.</p>

					<p>Just then a T/2 rushed into
					  crew quarters and shouted:
					  “Hey, is Boone around? Has
					  anyone seen Boone?”</p>

					<p>This brought general laughter.
					  Under the circumstances,
					  the question was not without
					  its humorous aspect.</p>

					<p>“What’ll you have?” Boone
					  demanded.</p>

					<p>“The refrigs, Boone! They
					  are on the blink. Overstrained
					  themselves and burned themselves
					  out. Inside of half an
					  hour this ship’s going to be an
					  oven hot enough to kill us all!”</p>

					<p>“Half an hour, men!” Ackerman
					  Boone cried. “Now, do
					  we take over the ship and man
					  those lifeboats or don’t we!”</p>

					<p>The roar which followed his
					  words was a decidedly affirmative
					  one.</p>

					<hr class="thoughtbreak">

					  <p class="post_thoughtbreak">“These are the figures,” Admiral
					    Stapleton said. “You can
					    see, Mr. President, that we

					  <p>“Admiral, I have to hand it

					    degrees and rising. We’ve
					    passed salt tablets out to
					    everyone, sir, but even then
					    it’s only a matter of time before
					    we’re all prostrated. If
					    you’re sure you give your permission,
					    sir—”</p>

					  <p>“Admiral Stapleton, you are
					    running this ship, not I.”</p>

					  <p>“Very well, sir. I’ve sent
					    our subspace officer, Lieutenant
					    Ormundy, to throw in the
					    subspace drive. We should
					    know in a few moments—”</p>

					  <p>“No crash hammocks or
					    anything?”</p>

					  <p>“I’m sorry, sir.”</p>

					  <p>“It isn’t your fault, Admiral.
					    I was merely pointing
					    out a fact.”</p>

					  <p>The <ins title="original reads &#39;squack&#39;">squawk</ins> box blared:
					    “Now hear this! Now hear
					    this! T/3 Ackerman Boone to
					    Admiral Stapleton. Are you
					    listening, Admiral?”</p>

					  <p>Admiral Stapleton’s haggard,
					    heat-worn face bore a
					    look of astonishment as he
					    listened. Ackerman said, “We
					    have Lieutenant Ormundy,
					    Admiral. He’s not killing us
					    all by putting us into subspace
					    in minutes when it ought to
					    take hours, you understand.
					    We have Ormundy and we
					    <a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55">&nbsp;</a>have the subspace room. A
					    contingent of our men is getting
					    the lifeboats ready. We’re
					    going to abandon ship, Admiral,
					    all of us, including you
					    and the politicians even if we
					    have to drag you aboard the
					    lifeboats at N—gunpoint.”</p>

					  <p>Admiral Stapleton’s face
					    went ashen. “Let me at a radio!”
					    he roared. “I want to
					    answer that man and see if
					    he understands exactly what
					    mutiny is!”</p>

					  <p>While Ackerman Boone was
					    talking over the squawk box,
					    the temperature within the
					    <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i> rose to
					    145° Fahrenheit.</p>

					  <hr class="thoughtbreak">

					    <p class="post_thoughtbreak">“Fifteen minutes,” Larry
					      Grange said. “In fifteen
					      minutes the heat will have us
					      all unconscious.” Only it
					      wasn’t Larry alone who was
					      talking. It was Larry and
					      Johnny Mayhem. In a surprisingly
					      short time the young
					      Secret Serviceman had come
					      to accept the dual occupation
					      of his own mind. It was there:
					      it was either dual occupation
					      or insanity and if the voice
					      which spoke inside his head
					      said it was Johnny Mayhem,
					      then it was Johnny Mayhem.
					      Besides, Larry felt clear-headed
					      in a way he had never
					      felt before, despite the terrible,
					      sapping heat. It was as
					      if he had matured suddenly—the
					      word matured came to him
					      instinctively—in the space of
					      minutes. Or, as if a maturing
					      influence were at work on his
					      mind.</p>

					    <p>“What can we do?” Sheila
					      said. “The crew has complete
					      control of the ship.”</p>

					    <p>“Secret Service chief says
					      we’re on our own. There’s no
					      time for co-ordinated planning,
					      but somehow, within a
					      very few minutes, we’ve got
					      to get inside the subspace
					      room and throw the ship out
					      of normal space or we’ll all be
					      roasted.”</p>

					    <p>“Some of your men are
					      there now, aren’t they?”</p>

					    <p>“In the companionway outside
					      the subspace room, yeah.
					      But they’ll never force their
					      way in time. Not with blasters
					      and not with N-guns, either.
					      Not in ten minutes, they
					      won’t.”</p>

					    <p>“Larry, all of a sudden I—I’m
					      scared. We’re all going to
					      die, Larry. I don’t want—Larry,
					      what are you going to do?”</p>

					    <p>They had been walking in a
					      deserted companionway which
					      brought them to one of the
					      aft escape hatches of the
					      <i>Glory of the Galaxy</i>. Their
					      clothing was plastered to their
					      bodies with sweat and every
					      breath was agonizing, furnace
					      hot.</p>

					    <p>“I’m going outside,” Larry
					      said quietly.</p>

					    <p><a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56">&nbsp;</a>“Outside? What do you
					      mean?”</p>

					    <p>“Spacesuit, outside. There’s
					      a hatch in the subspace room.
					      If their attention is diverted
					      to the companionway door, I
					      may be able to get in. It’s our
					      only chance—ours, and everyone’s.”</p>

					    <p>“But the spacesuit—”</p>

					    <p>“I know,” Larry said even
					      as he was climbing into the
					      inflatable vacuum garment. It
					      was Larry—and it wasn’t
					      Larry. He felt a certain confidence,
					      a certain sense of doing
					      the right thing—a feeling
					      which Larry Grange had
					      never experienced before in
					      his life. It was as if the boy
					      had become a man in the final
					      moments of his life—or, he
					      thought all at once, it was as
					      if Johnny Mayhem who
					      shared his mind and his body
					      with him was somehow transmitting
					      some of his own skills
					      and confidence even as he—Mayhem—had
					      reached the decision
					      to go outside.</p>

					    <p>“I know,” he said. “The
					      spacesuit isn’t insulated sufficiently.
					      I’ll have about three
					      minutes out there. Three minutes
					      to get inside. Otherwise,
					      I’m finished.”</p>

					    <p>“But Larry—”</p>

					    <p>“Don’t you see, Sheila?
					      What does it matter? Who
					      wants the five or ten extra
					      minutes if we’re all going to
					      die anyway? This way, there’s
					      a chance.”</p>

					    <p>He buckled the spacesuit
					      and lifted the heavy fishbowl
					      helmet, preparing to set it on
					      his shoulders.</p>

					    <p>“Wait,” Sheila said, and
					      stood on tiptoes to take his
					      face in her hands and kiss him
					      on the lips. “You—you’re different,”
					      Sheila said. “You’re
					      the same guy, a lot of fun, but
					      you’re a—man, too. This is
					      for what might have been,
					      Larry,” she said, and kissed
					      him again. “This is because I
					      love you.”</p>

					    <p>Before he dropped the helmet
					      in place, Larry said. “It
					      isn’t for what might have
					      been, Sheila. It’s for what will
					      be.”</p>

					    <p>The helmet snapped shut
					      over the shoulder ridges of the
					      spacesuit. Moments later, he
					      had slipped into the airlock.</p>

					    <hr class="thoughtbreak">

					      <p class="post_thoughtbreak">“I say you’re a fool, Ackerman
						Boone!” one of the enlisted
						men rasped at the leader
						of the mutiny. “I say now
						we’ve lost our last chance.
						Now it’s too late to get into
						the lifeboats even if we
						wanted to. Now all we can do
						is—die!”</p>

					      <p>There were still ten conscious
						men in the subspace
						room. The others had fallen
						before heat prostration and
						lay strewn about the floor,
						<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57">&nbsp;</a>wringing wet and oddly flaccid
						as if all the moisture had
						been wrung from their bodies
						except for the sweat which
						covered their skins.</p>

					      <p>“All right,” Ackerman
						Boone admitted. “All right, so
						none of us knows how to work
						the subspace mechanism. You
						think that would have helped?
						It would have killed us all, I
						tell you.”</p>

					      <p>“It was a chance, Boone.
						Our last chance and you—”</p>

					      <p>“Just shut up!” Boone
						snarled. “I know what you’re
						thinking. You’re thinking we
						ought to let them officers and
						Secret Servicemen to ram
						home the subspace drive. But
						use your head, man. Probably
						they’ll kill us all, but if they
						don’t—”</p>

					      <p>“Then you admit there’s a
						chance!”</p>

					      <p>“Yeah. All right, a chance.
						But if they don’t kill us all, if
						they save us by ramming
						home the subspacer, what happens?
						We’re all taken in on a
						mutiny charge. It’s a capital
						offense, you fool!”</p>

					      <p>“Well, it’s better than sure
						death,” the man said, and
						moved toward the door.</p>

					      <p>“Allister, wait!” Boone
						cried. “Wait, I’m warning you.
						Any man who tries to open
						that door—”</p>

					      <p>Outside, a steady booming
						of blaster fire could be heard,
						but the assault-proof door
						stood fast.</p>

					      <p>“—is going to get himself
						killed!” Boone finished.</p>

					      <p>Grimly, Allister reached the
						door and got his already blistered
						fingers on the lock mechanism.</p>

					      <p>Ackerman Boone shot him
						in the back with an N-gun.</p>

					      <hr class="thoughtbreak">

						<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Larry’s whole body felt like
						  one raw mass of broken blisters
						  as, flat on his belly, he
						  inched his way along the outside
						  hull of the <em>Glory of the
						    Galaxy</em>. He had no idea what
						  the heat was out here, but it
						  radiated off the hot hull of the
						  <i>Glory</i> in scalding, suffocating
						  waves which swept right
						  through the insulining of the
						  spacesuit. If he didn’t find the
						  proper hatch, and in a matter
						  of seconds….</p>

						<hr class="thoughtbreak">

						  <p class="post_thoughtbreak">“Anyone else?” Ackerman
						    Boone screamed. “Anyone else
						    like Allister?”</p>

						  <p>But one by one the remaining
						    men were dropping from
						    the heat. Finally—alone—Ackerman
						    Boone faced the
						    door and stared defiantly at
						    the hot metal as if he could see
						    his adversaries through it. On
						    the other side, the firing became
						    more sporadic as the officers
						    and Secret Servicemen
						    collapsed. His mind crazed
						    with the heat and with fear,
						    <a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58">&nbsp;</a>Ackerman Boone suddenly
						    wished he could see the men
						    through the door, wished he
						    could see them die….</p>

						  <hr class="thoughtbreak">

						    <p class="post_thoughtbreak">It was this hatch or nothing.
						      He thought it was the
						      right one, but couldn’t be sure.
						      He could no longer see. His
						      vision had gone completely.
						      The pain was a numb thing
						      now, far away, hardly a part
						      of himself. Maybe Mayhem
						      was absorbing the pain-sensation
						      for him, he thought.
						      Maybe Mayhem took the pain
						      and suffered with it in the
						      shared body so he, Larry,
						      could still think. Maybe—</p>

						    <p>His blistered fingers were
						      barely able to move within the
						      insulined gloves, Larry fumbled
						      with the hatch.</p>

						    <hr class="thoughtbreak">

						      <p class="post_thoughtbreak">Ackerman Boone whirled
							suddenly. He had been intent
							upon the companionway door
							and the sounds behind him—which
							he had heard but not
							registered as dangerous for
							several seconds—now made
							him turn.</p>

						      <p>The man was peeling off a
							space suit. Literally peeling it
							off in strips from his lobster-red
							flesh. He blinked at Boone
							without seeing him. Dazzle-blinded,
							Boone thought, then
							realized his own vision was
							going.</p>

						      <p>“I’ll kill you if you go near
							that subspace drive!” Boone
							screamed.</p>

						      <p>“It’s the only chance for all
							of us and you know it, Boone,”
							the man said quietly. “Don’t
							try to stop me.”</p>

						      <p>Ackerman Boone lifted his
							N-gun and squinted through
							the haze of heat and blinding
							light. He couldn’t see! He
							couldn’t see….</p>

						      <p>Wildly, he fired the N-gun.
							Wildly, in all directions,
							spraying the room with it—</p>

						      <p>Larry dropped blindly forward.
							Twice he tripped over
							unconscious men, but climbed
							to his feet and went on. He
							could not see Boone, but he
							could see—vaguely—the muzzle
							flash of Boone’s N-gun. He
							staggered across the room toward
							that muzzle-flash and finally
							embraced it—</p>

						      <p>And found himself fighting
							for his life. Boone was crazed
							now—with the heat and with
							his own failure. He bit and
							tore at Larry with strong
							claw-like fingers and lashed
							out with his feet. He balled his
							fists and hammered air like a
							windmill, arms flailing, striking
							flesh often enough to batter
							Larry toward the floor.</p>

						      <p>Grimly Larry clung to him,
							pulled himself upright, ducked
							his head against his chest and
							struck out with his own fists,
							feeling nothing, not knowing
							when they landed and when
							<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59">&nbsp;</a>they did not, hearing nothing
							but a far off roaring in his
							ears, a roaring which told him
							he was losing consciousness
							and had to act—soon—if he
							was going to save anyone….</p>

						      <p>He stood and pounded with
							his fists.</p>

						      <p>Pounded—air.</p>

						      <p>He did not know that Boone
							had collapsed until his feet
							trod on the man’s inert body
							and then, quickly, he rushed
							toward the control board,
							rushed blindly in its direction,
							or in the direction he thought
							it would be, tripped over
							something, sprawled on the
							hot, blistering floor, got himself
							up somehow, crawled
							forward, pulled himself upright….</p>

						      <p>There was no sensation in
							his fingers. He did not know
							if he had actually reached the
							control board but abruptly he
							realized that he had not felt
							Mayhem’s presence in his
							mind for several minutes. Was
							Mayhem conserving his energy
							for a final try, letting
							Larry absorb the punishment
							now so he—</p>

						      <p>Yes, Larry remembered
							thinking vaguely. It had to be
							that. For Mayhem knew how
							to work the controls, and he
							did not. Now his mind receded
							into a fog of semi-consciousness,
							but he was aware that
							his blistered fingers were fairly
							flying across the control
							board, aware then of an inward
							sigh—whether of relief
							or triumph, he was never to
							know—then aware, abruptly
							and terribly, of a wrenching
							pain which seemed to strip his
							skin from his flesh, his flesh
							from his bones, the marrow
							from….</p>

						      <hr class="thoughtbreak">

							<p class="post_thoughtbreak">“Can you see?” the doctor
							  asked.</p>

							<p>“Yes,” Larry said as the
							  bandages were removed from
							  his eyes. Three people were in
							  the room with the doctor—Admiral
							  Stapleton, the President—and
							  Sheila. Somehow,
							  Sheila was most important.</p>

							<p>“We are now in subspace,
							  thanks to you,” the Admiral
							  said. “We all have minor injuries
							  as a result of the transfer,
							  but there were only two
							  fatalities, I’m happy to say.
							  And naturally, the ship is now
							  out of danger.”</p>

							<p>“What gets me, Grange,”
							  the President said, “is how
							  you managed to work those
							  controls. What the devil do
							  you know about sub-space, my
							  boy?”</p>

							<p>“The two fatalities,” the
							  Admiral said, “were Ackerman
							  Boone and the man he
							  had killed.” Then the Admiral
							  grinned. “Can’t you see, Mr.
							  President, that he’s not paying
							  any attention to us? I think,
							  <a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60">&nbsp;</a>at the moment, the hero of the
							  hour only has eyes for Miss
							  Kelly here.”</p>

							<p>“Begging your pardons,
							  sirs, yes,” Larry said happily.</p>

							<p>Nodding and smiling, the
							  President of the Galactic Federation
							  and Admiral Stapleton
							  left the dispensary room—with
							  the doctor.</p>

							<p>“Well, hero,” Sheila said,
							  and smiled.</p>

							<p>Larry realized—quite suddenly—that,
							  inside himself,
							  he was alone. Mayhem had
							  done his job—and vanished
							  utterly.</p>

							<p>“You know,” Sheila said,
							  “it’s as if you—well, I hope
							  this doesn’t get you sore at
							  me—as if you grew up overnight.”</p>

							<p>Before he kissed her Larry
							  said: “Maybe you’re right.
							  Maybe I’ll tell you about it
							  someday. But you’d never believe
							  me.”</p>

							  property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

							  Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

							  Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
							  electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
							  including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
							  because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
							  people in all walks of life.

							  Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
							  assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
							  goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
							  remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
							  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
							  and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
							  To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
							  and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
							  and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

							  Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
							  Literary Archive Foundation

							  Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
							  spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
							  increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
							  freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
							  array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
							  ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
							  status with the IRS.

							  The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
							  charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
							  States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
							  considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
							  with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
							  where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
							  SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
							  particular state visit http://pglaf.org

							  While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
							  have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
							  against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
							  approach us with offers to donate.

							  International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
							  any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
							  outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

							  Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
							  methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
							  ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
							  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


							  Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
							  works.

							  Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
							  concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
							  with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
							  Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


							  Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
							  editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
							  unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
							  keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


							  Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

							  http://www.gutenberg.org

							  This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
							  including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
							  Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
							  subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
